Agricultural markets are often subject to abrupt fluctuations and high volatility, making it essential for investors and policymakers to understand the factors driving these changes. Sentiment analysis, derived from news sources and social media, offers an additional layer of data that complements traditional econometric models, providing a broader understanding of market behavior. This research will utilize time series data of agricultural commodity prices and sentiment metrics obtained through natural language processing (NLP) tools applied to news data.\nThe proposed methods include the application of econometric models such as conditional volatility analysis (GARCH) and structural break models (e.g., the Bai-Perron model) to capture the effects of market sentiment on price fluctuations. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization model will be used to adjust agricultural commodity portfolios, accounting for the sentiment-driven volatility impact. Expected results include identifying a significant relationship between market sentiment and price variations, as well as validating an optimized approach to managing commodity portfolios, based on both sentiment data and volatility patterns.\nThis study will provide valuable insights for portfolio managers and investors, enabling them to incorporate sentiment indicators into their investment strategies and improve the forecasting of commodity market fluctuations. The relevance of this research lies in the growing need to understand how qualitative variables, such as market sentiment, affect agricultural commodity prices in the context of global economic uncertainties.\nKeyWords: Sentiment Analysis, Time Series, Volatility, Structural Breaks, Portfolio Optimization, Commodity Prices.\n\n\n\nJournal\nText Match Score (1 to 5)\nCiteScore\nAcceptance Rate (%)\nTime to First Decision (days)\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Commodity Markets\n5\n4.3\n-\n60\n\n\nFinance Research Letters\n5\n11.1\n24%\n10\n\n\nEnergy Economics\n5\n10.8\n-\n30\n\n\nJournal of Business Research\n4\n11.2\n-\n12\n\n\nEconomic Modelling\n5\n5.8\n-\n18\n\n\nJournal of Banking and Finance\n5\n6.4\n25%\n40\n\n\nJournal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance\n4\n4.5\n-\n6\n\n\nEmerging Markets Review\n5\n4.1\n-\n30\n\n\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture\n5\n7.6\n30%\n15\n\n\nInternational Economics\n4\n3.9\n-\n45\n\n\n\nSource: Elsevier Journal Finder Results\n\n\n\nPaper 2\n\nPaper title: “Ablation Study of a CNN+LSTM Architecture for Time Series Forecasting of Corn Price Returns” by Rodrigo Hermont Ozon\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper presents an ablation study of a hybrid CNN+LSTM architecture applied to the forecasting of logarithmic returns of corn prices. Different hyperparameter configurations are explored, including the addition/removal of layers, changes in loss functions, and variations in optimizers. Results are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)). The conclusions provide insights into the critical components of the architecture for modeling complex time series data.\nKeywords: Time Series, CNN+LSTM, Ablation Study, Price Forecasting, Artificial Neural Networks.\n\n\n\nJournal\nText Match Score\nCiteScore\nAcceptance Rate (%)\nTime to First Decision (days)\n\n\n\n\nNeurocomputing\n5\n8.7\n30%\n45\n\n\nExpert Systems with Applications\n5\n12.2\n28%\n30\n\n\nJournal of Forecasting\n4\n4.1\n25%\n60\n\n\nApplied Soft Computing\n5\n10.5\n27%\n50\n\n\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence\n5\n7.8\n26%\n40\n\n\n\nSource: Elsevier Journal Finder Results\n\n\n\nPaper 3\n\nPaper title: “Blending Forecasting Models for Commodities Portfolio Optimization” by Rodrigo Hermont Ozon and Robson Guedes\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe intricacies of the global commodities market, characterized by its inherent volatility, necessitate robust forecasting methodologies to guide stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Traditional time series forecasting models, while foundational, often grapple with capturing the multifaceted dynamics of commodity prices. This paper introduces an innovative approach to commodities portfolio optimization by synergistically blending time series forecasting models within Pareto Front Scenarios. By integrating bootstrapping techniques across models such as Dynamic Harmonic Regression, DHR with multiple seasonal periods, STL with multiple seasonal, Auto ARIMA, and non-linear regression with cubic splines, we enhance the predictive accuracy and robustness of our forecasting framework. Our findings underscore the efficacy of this integrative approach, offering a nuanced, actionable framework for commodities portfolio optimization. This research not only contributes to the academic discourse on commodities forecasting but also provides practical insights for investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the commodities market.\nKeywords: Commodities Portfolio Optimization; Time Series Forecasting; Pareto Front Scenarios\n\n\n\nJournal\nText Match Score (1 to 5)\nCiteScore\nAcceptance Rate (%)\nTime to First Decision (days)\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Commodity Markets\n5\n4.3\n-\n60\n\n\nAgricultural Economics\n5\n4.2\n-\n45\n\n\nFood Policy\n5\n6.8\n-\n30\n\n\nEnergy Economics\n4\n10.8\n-\n30\n\n\nEconomic Modelling\n4\n5.8\n-\n18\n\n\nJournal of Agricultural and Resource Economics\n4\n1.5\n-\n60\n\n\nApplied Economics\n4\n3.0\n-\n50\n\n\nJournal of International Money and Finance\n4\n4.1\n-\n40\n\n\nEmerging Markets Review\n4\n4.1\n-\n30\n\n\nJournal of Futures Markets\n5\n3.2\n-\n40\n\n\n\nSource: Elsevier Journal Finder Results\n\n\n\nPaper 4\n\nPaper title: “Portfolio Optimization with GARCH Models Using Multiple Time Windows for Pareto Frontiers” by Rodrigo Hermont Ozon, José Donizzetti da Fonseca e Géremi Dranka\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis study introduces a novel approach for portfolio optimization by employing Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to assess risk and construct Pareto frontiers over multiple time windows. Traditional risk measures such as the standard deviation may fail to capture risk accurately in financial markets where volatility is time-varying. By modeling conditional volatility, GARCH models offer a more comprehensive depiction of risk. In this paper, we implement this approach in the non-diversified portfolio optimization of two commodities, corn and soy, projecting their price dynamics 252 days ahead. The results demonstrate that the application of GARCH models and multi-period Pareto frontiers can significantly enhance portfolio optimization, providing fresh insights into purchasing and selling opportunities in the commodities market. This study adds to the current literature by addressing the gaps in applying Pareto frontiers across multiple time windows and utilizing GARCH models for risk measurement.\nKeywords: Portfolio Optimization, GARCH Models, Pareto Frontiers.\n\n\n\nJournal\nText Match Score (1 to 5)\nCiteScore\nAcceptance Rate (%)\nTime to First Decision (days)\n\n\n\n\nJournal of Commodity Markets\n5\n4.3\n-\n60\n\n\nFinance Research Letters\n5\n11.1\n24\n10\n\n\nEnergy Economics\n5\n10.8\n-\n30\n\n\nEconomic Modelling\n5\n5.8\n-\n18\n\n\nJournal of Banking and Finance\n5\n6.4\n25\n40\n\n\nJournal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance\n4\n4.5\n-\n6\n\n\nEmerging Markets Review\n5\n4.1\n-\n30\n\n\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture\n5\n7.6\n30\n15\n\n\nInternational Economics\n4\n3.9\n-\n45\n\n\nJournal of Financial Markets\n4\n5.2\n-\n50\n\n\n\nSource: Elsevier Journal Finder Results\n\n\n\n\nPaper 5\n\nPaper title: “Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on Corn Prices, Returns, and Volatility: A Quasi-Experimental Approach” by Rodrigo Hermont Ozon\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper investigates the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on corn futures prices, returns, and volatility.
