    <p>This paper presents an integrated methodology for simulating future scenarios of corn prices. First, a GARCH(1,1) model with a skewed Student‑t distribution is fitted to capture the conditional volatility of returns. Next, standardized residuals are computed to identify extreme events (jumps), which are used to calibrate a Hawkes process modeling the self-excitation of these shocks. Finally, the forecasts from the GARCH model are combined with the simulated jumps to generate three future price trajectories for the next 252 trading days.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Forecasting asset prices is a crucial topic in both academic research and risk management. Among the widely used models, the <strong>GARCH(1,1)</strong> model is popular for modeling the conditional volatility of returns, while the <strong>Hawkes process</strong> is effective in modeling the occurrence of extreme events (or “jumps”) that are not captured by traditional volatility measures.</p>
<p>In this paper, we integrate both models. The GARCH(1,1) model with a skewed Student‑t distribution is employed to capture the dynamics of conditional volatility. The model is specified as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2,
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> are the shocks and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span> is the conditional volatility. The use of a skewed Student‑t distribution (denoted as <code>sstd</code> in the <strong>rugarch</strong> package) allows us to capture heavy tails and asymmetry—characteristics often observed in financial return data.</p>
<p>Next, standardized residuals are computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\varepsilon}_t = \frac{\varepsilon_t}{\sigma_t},
\]</span></p>
<p>and extreme events are defined as those for which <span class="math inline">\(|\tilde{\varepsilon}_t| &gt; 2\)</span>. These extreme events are then used to calibrate a Hawkes process with the intensity function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lambda(t) = \mu_h + \alpha_h \sum_{t_j &lt; t} e^{-\beta_h (t-t_j)},
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_h\)</span> is the baseline intensity, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_h\)</span> quantifies the influence of past events, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_h\)</span> is the decay rate.</p>
<p>Finally, the forecasted baseline returns from the GARCH model are combined with the simulated jumps from the Hawkes process to generate three future price trajectories for the next 252 trading days.</p>

<h1>Gaps in literature for combining GARCH and Hawkes simulation methods</h1>
<section id="systematic-literature-review" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systematic-literature-review">Systematic Literature Review</h2>
<p>Forecasting financial time series has been extensively studied using econometric models and machine learning techniques. Among these models, <strong>Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)</strong> models are widely used to model conditional volatility, while the <strong>Hawkes process</strong> is employed to capture the occurrence of extreme events and self-exciting shocks. However, the integration of these two models remains underexplored, presenting a significant gap in the literature.</p>
<section id="garch-models-and-their-extensions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garch-models-and-their-extensions">1. GARCH Models and Their Extensions</h3>
<p>GARCH models are traditionally applied to capture conditional heteroskedasticity in financial returns. Previous studies have explored various extensions of the GARCH model, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GARCH combined with Neural Networks</strong>: The <strong>GARCH-GRNN</strong> model has been proposed to enhance forecasting by combining the statistical modeling of GARCH with the flexibility of neural networks <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/11569596_59.pdf">(Li et al., 2005)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bilinear-GARCH (BL-GARCH) Models</strong>: This approach augments the traditional GARCH model by incorporating bilinear modeling to capture more complex nonlinearities, demonstrating improved performance in financial time series forecasting <a href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ajam.20130101.14">(Oyewale et al., 2013)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hybrid GARCH-Deep Learning Models</strong>: Models integrating deep neural networks with GARCH, such as GRU-GARCH, have been tested for volatility and risk forecasting <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06642v1.pdf">(Michańków et al., 2023)</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While these approaches improve volatility forecasting, they still fail to fully capture the dynamics of extreme events and their interactions over time.</p>

<section id="hawkes-processes-in-extreme-event-modeling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hawkes-processes-in-extreme-event-modeling">2. Hawkes Processes in Extreme Event Modeling</h3>
<p>Hawkes processes are widely used for modeling financial shocks due to their self-exciting nature. However, existing literature primarily focuses on applying these models to predict <strong>isolated extreme events</strong>, without integrating them with traditional volatility models. A recent study introduced the <strong>2T-POT Hawkes model</strong>, which enhances conditional quantile forecasting for extreme log returns and outperforms GARCH-EVT models for financial risk prediction <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12345.pdf">(Tomlinson et al., 2022)</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this advancement, the study does not explicitly combine Hawkes processes with GARCH models, which could further improve predictive performance by integrating both volatility modeling and extreme event structure.</p>
</section>
<section id="gaps-in-the-literature-and-justification-for-the-proposed-approach" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gaps-in-the-literature-and-justification-for-the-proposed-approach">3. Gaps in the Literature and Justification for the Proposed Approach</h3>
<p>The main gap in the literature lies in the <strong>lack of integration between GARCH models and Hawkes processes</strong> for financial time series forecasting. While several studies have explored variations of GARCH and machine learning techniques, no work has comprehensively addressed the <strong>combination of GARCH forecasts with Hawkes-based scenario simulation</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper aims to bridge this gap by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Integrating GARCH(1,1) forecasts (with a skewed Student-t distribution) with a Hawkes process</strong>, allowing us to capture both the dynamics of conditional volatility and the temporal structure of extreme events.</li>
<li><strong>Simulating future scenarios that account not only for forecasted volatility but also for the occurrence of self-exciting shocks</strong>, resulting in more robust predictions than machine learning or deep learning models alone.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming the limitations of existing models</strong>, which often fail to properly capture structural breaks and the self-excitation of extreme financial shocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The literature suggests that hybrid models hold promise for financial forecasting, yet the specific combination of GARCH and Hawkes processes remains largely unexplored. This study aims to contribute to this field by developing a methodological framework that enhances predictive accuracy and robustness in financial asset forecasting.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Our methodology integrates a GARCH(1,1) model with a skewed Student‑t distribution and a Hawkes process to simulate future price trajectories. The approach is divided into several steps:</p>
<section id="data-preparation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation">2.1. Data Preparation</h2>
<p>First, we download historical corn price data and compute daily log-returns. Let <span class="math inline">\(P_t\)</span> denote the closing price at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The log-return is computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_t = \ln(P_t) - \ln(P_{t-1}).
\]</span></p>
<p>These returns form the basis for our subsequent volatility modeling.</p>
</section>
<section id="garch11-model-with-skewed-studentt-distribution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="garch11-model-with-skewed-studentt-distribution">2.2. GARCH(1,1) Model with Skewed Student‑t Distribution</h2>
<p>We model the conditional variance of returns using a GARCH(1,1) process. The conditional variance is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1\,\sigma_{t-1}^2,
\]</span></p>
<p>where: -<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> are the shocks, -<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span> is the conditional volatility, -<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the constant term, -<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> represents the ARCH effect, -<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> represents the GARCH effect.</p>
<p>In our model, we assume that the return innovations follow a skewed Student‑t distribution (denoted as <code>sstd</code> in the <strong>rugarch</strong> package), which is well-suited to capture heavy tails and asymmetry often observed in financial data.</p>
<p>After fitting the model, we extract the conditional volatility <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span> for each time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="identification-of-extreme-events" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identification-of-extreme-events">2.3. Identification of Extreme Events</h2>
<p>To identify extreme events, we compute the standardized residuals:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\varepsilon}_t = \frac{\varepsilon_t}{\sigma_t}.
\]</span></p>
<p>We define an event as “extreme” if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left|\tilde{\varepsilon}_t\right| &gt; \tau,
\]</span></p>
<p>with a chosen threshold (for example,<span class="math inline">\(\tau=2\)</span>). These extreme events (or jumps) are used to calibrate the Hawkes process.</p>
</section>
<section id="calibration-of-the-hawkes-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calibration-of-the-hawkes-process">2.4. Calibration of the Hawkes Process</h2>
<p>The Hawkes process is a self-exciting point process used to model the occurrence of extreme events. Its intensity function is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lambda(t) = \mu_h + \alpha_h \sum_{t_j &lt; t} e^{-\beta_h (t-t_j)},
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>-<span class="math inline">\(\mu_h\)</span> is the baseline intensity, -<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_h\)</span> quantifies the impact of past events, -<span class="math inline">\(\beta_h\)</span> is the decay rate.</p>
<p>We calibrate the parameters <span class="math inline">\((\mu_h, \alpha_h, \beta_h)\)</span> by maximizing the log-likelihood function based on the historical occurrence times of extreme events. The log-likelihood function is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}(\mu_h, \alpha_h, \beta_h) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ln\left(\mu_h + \alpha_h \sum_{t_j &lt; t_i} e^{-\beta_h (t_i-t_j)}\right) - \mu_h T - \frac{\alpha_h}{\beta_h}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(1-e^{-\beta_h (T-t_j)}\right),
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>-<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the total observation period, -<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of extreme events.</p>
<p>We solve for the parameters using numerical optimization techniques.</p>
</section>
<section id="simulation-of-future-price-trajectories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulation-of-future-price-trajectories">2.5. Simulation of Future Price Trajectories</h2>
<p>The final step is to simulate future price trajectories over a forecast horizon (e.g., 252 trading days). The simulation involves two components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Baseline Returns:</strong><br>
These are generated using the GARCH forecast for the next 252 days, assuming that returns follow a normal distribution with forecasted mean and volatility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jumps:</strong><br>
For each day, if the Hawkes process simulates extreme events, jump magnitudes are sampled from the historical extreme returns and added to the baseline return.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The total return for day <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_t^{\text{total}} = r_t^{\text{baseline}} + r_t^{\text{jump}},
\]</span></p>
<p>and the simulated price is computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_t = P_0 \times \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t} r_i^{\text{total}}\right),
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is the last observed price.</p>
<p>We repeat this simulation multiple times (e.g., 3 scenarios) to capture the uncertainty in the future price evolution.</p>

<p>The model summary shows that the mean return$ $ is close to zero, which is expected for daily returns. The parameters<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span>, and$ _1$ indicate a low base level of volatility with high persistence, as evidenced by the sum <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1 + \beta_1\)</span> being close to 1. The skew and shape parameters reveal that the distribution has heavy tails and slight asymmetry, which justifies the use of a skewed Student‑t distribution for modeling the innovations.</p>
<p>After fitting the model, we extract the conditional volatility, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_t\)</span>, for further analysis:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this paper, we presented an integrated methodology that combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The modeling of conditional volatility via a GARCH(1,1) model with a skewed Student‑t distribution,</li>
<li>The identification of extreme events using standardized residuals,</li>
<li>The calibration of a Hawkes process to model the self-excitation of shocks,</li>
<li>The simulation of three future price scenarios for corn, incorporating both baseline returns and jumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach offers a more realistic view of the risks and dynamics in volatile markets, and it is especially useful for risk management and decision-making.</p>
