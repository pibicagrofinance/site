This exploratory literature review applies text mining techniques to investigate the intersection of sentiment analysis, volatility models, structural breaks, and multiobjective portfolio optimization within agricultural markets. The study focuses on identifying key research trends and gaps through keyword-based searches such as "Sentiment Analysis AND Commodity Prices," "Volatility Models AND Agricultural Markets," "Structural Breaks AND Agricultural Prices," and "Multiobjective Portfolio Optimization AND Commodities." By analyzing recent publications, this review aims to highlight the impact of sentiment metrics on commodity price volatility and structural disruptions, and how these factors influence portfolio optimization strategies in the agricultural sector. The results will provide insights into the evolving relationship between market sentiment, price dynamics, and risk management.

Our baseline forecasting model is a heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model, which we extend to include sentiment. We further enhance this model by incorporating various key realized moments such as leverage, realized skewness, realized kurtosis, realized upside (“good”) volatility, realized downside (“bad”) volatility, realized jumps, realized upside tail risk, and realized downside tail risk. In order to setup a forecasting model, we use (i) forward and backward stepwise predictor selection and (ii) a model‐based averaging algorithm. The forecasting models constructed through these algorithms outperform both the baseline HAR‐RV model and the HAR‐RV‐sentiment model. We conclude that, for the agricultural commodities studied in our research, realized moments play a more significant role in forecasting realized volatility compared to sentiment.<\/jats:p>","16":"0277-6693,1099-131X"},{"1":"The rise and breakup of the commodity exchange membership: An analysis of CBOT seat prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100173","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100173","9":"2021 dez","10":"23.70100","11":"40","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Commodity prices and GDP growth","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2020.101512","5":"International Review of Financial Analysis","6":"International Review of Financial Analysis","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.irfa.2020.101512","9":"2020 out","10":"23.30619","11":"27","12":"22","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1057-5219"},{"1":"Time Series for Forecasting Stock Market Prices Based on Sentiment Analysis of Social Media","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-6303-1.ch027","5":"Research Anthology on Implementing Sentiment Analysis Across Multiple Disciplines","6":"NA","7":"IGI Global","8":"10.4018/978-1-6684-6303-1.ch027","9":"2022 jun","10":"23.07467","11":"12","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:p>This paper attempts to find a relation between the public perception of a company and its stock value price.

The results show significant transmission from oil and food prices to domestic inflation. Specifically, the food prices are shown more important than oil prices in explaining inflation in the short-run, which reflects the high weight of food in the consumption basket. However, the effect of oil prices on inflation is much more persistent than the effect of food prices. Furthermore, the impact of commodity price shocks on inflation exhibits asymmetries. The oil price hikes affect more weakly the inflation than oil price decreases, whereas the food price increases are more transmitted to inflation than food price decreases. Our findings may provide useful information to researchers and policymakers in formulating more appropriate monetary policy.<\/jats:p>","16":"2501-3165,2501-1960"},{"1":"The relationship between commodity prices and world trade uncertainty","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2020.05.001","5":"Economic Analysis and Policy","6":"Economic Analysis and Policy","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eap.2020.05.001","9":"2020 jun","10":"21.49937","11":"29","12":"16","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0313-5926"},{"1":"An Empirical Analysis of the Factors Influencing Commodity Housing Prices in China Based on Econometrics","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1142/9789811267505_0009","5":"Internet Finance and Digital Economy","6":"NA","7":"WORLD SCIENTIFIC","8":"10.1142/9789811267505_0009","9":"2023 set","10":"21.45106","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Predicting Bitcoin Prices Using Sentiment Analysis Results","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3537693.3537700","5":"2022 6th International Conference on E-Commerce, E-Business and E-Government","6":"NA","7":"ACM","8":"10.1145/3537693.3537700","9":"2022 abr","10":"21.20684","11":"12","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Sentiment score for finance decision: An analysis for investment in Indian commodity market","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003313663-7","5":"Building Resilient Organizations","6":"NA","7":"Routledge","8":"10.4324/9781003313663-7","9":"2022 set","10":"21.15075","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"A Commodity Review Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-CNN Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icccs49078.2020.9118434","5":"2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/icccs49078.2020.9118434","9":"2020 mai","10":"21.14948","11":"8","12":"27","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Commodity Prices and Competitive Storage","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76753-2_7","5":"Contributions to Economics,Natural Resource Pricing and Rents","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-030-76753-2_7","9":"2021 jan","10":"21.00539","11":"11","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1431-1933,2197-7178"},{"1":"Commodity prices at the quantiles","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23737484.2021.1972877","5":"Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications","6":"Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/23737484.2021.1972877","9":"2022 jan","10":"20.99373","11":"47","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"2373-7484"},{"1":"International Commodity-Tax Competition and Asymmetric Producer Prices","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1515/bejeap-2022-0332","5":"The B.E.

Existing product review sentiment analysis models based on deep learning mostly use traditional word vector models. It is difficult to obtain the contextual semantic information of words, and there is a problem of “polysemous one word”. A product review sentiment analysis model combining ALBERT and LSTM is proposed. First, we use the ALBERT pre-training model to get the word vector containing sequence and semantic information. Then we use the LSTM model that can obtain long-distance semantic features for training. Finally, the emotional polarity of product reviews is classified and output through the emotional polarity discrimination layer. The experimental results on the data set of digital products of JD Mall show that the F1 value of the ALBERT-LSTM model is improved compared with the ALBERT and LSTM

In order to research this nonlinear dynamic correlation mechanism, we construct a nonlinear Granger causality test model and a nonlinear autoregressive distribution lag model including Chinese and international agricultural commodity (soybean, corn, rice, and wheat) price variables. Our empirical results reveal that a unidirectional causal relation exists between international and Chinese prices for soybeans and corn; specifically, international prices of soybeans and corn Granger-cause Chinese prices of soybeans and corn. Moreover, the pass-through effects between Chinese and international commodity prices are asymmetric; Chinese agricultural commodity prices respond more strongly to positive shocks than negative shocks of international agricultural commodity prices.<\/jats:p>","16":"1559-2448"},{"1":"The sugar-ethanol-oil nexus in Brazil: Exploring the pass-through of international commodity prices to national fuel prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100257","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100257","9":"2022 dez","10":"20.22252","11":"96","12":"10","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Commodity Prices and World Economic Recovery*","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003129349-7","5":"Prospects for Recovery in the British Economy","6":"NA","7":"Routledge","8":"10.4324/9781003129349-7","9":"2021 jun","10":"20.14923","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"How do USDA announcements affect international commodity prices?","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100239","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100239","9":"2022 dez","10":"20.13198","11":"27","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Analysis of Bitcoin prices using market and sentiment variables","2":"<tibble[,8]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1111/twec.13020","5":"The World Economy","6":"World Economy","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1111/twec.13020","9":"2021 jan","10":"20.13107","11":"41","12":"31","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This paper proposes an empirical model for analysing the dynamics of Bitcoin prices. To do this, we consider a vector error correction model over two overlapping periods: 2010–17 and 2010–19. Price discovery is achieved through the Gonzalo–Granger permanent‐transitory decomposition. The pricing factors are endogenous linear combinations of the S&amp;P 500 index, gold price, a Google search variable associated to Bitcoin and a fear index proxied by the FED Financial Stress Index. Our empirical analysis shows that during the first period, a linear combination of four pricing factors describes the efficient Bitcoin price. The S&amp;P 500 index and Google searches have a positive effect whereas gold prices and the fear index have a negative effect. In contrast, during the second period, the efficient price behaves idiosyncratically and can be only rationalised by individuals' search for information on the cryptocurrency. These findings provide empirical evidence on the presence of a correction in Bitcoin prices during the period 2018–19 uncorrelated to market fundamentals. We also show that standard empirical asset pricing models perform poorly for explaining Bitcoin prices.<\/jats:p>","16":"0378-5920,1467-9701"},{"1":"Analysis Of The Influence Of ESG Value And Commodity Prices On Company Stock Prices On ESG Quality 45 IDX Kehati","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202457103010","5":"E3S Web of Conferences","6":"E3S Web Conf.","7":"EDP Sciences","8":"10.1051/e3sconf/202457103010","9":"2024 jan","10":"20.06844","11":"20","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"<jats:p>The trend of sustainable investment is the choice of investors because of its environmentally friendly practices and long-term investment.

Modelling asymmetric cointegration and dynamic multipliers in a nonlinear ARDL framework. In Festschrift in Honor of Peter Schmidt: Econometric Methods and Applications, pp. 281–314. New York: Springer] to examine the dynamic effect of oil prices on other energy prices based on nonlinear empirical frameworks. We identify how oil prices and four other energy commodity prices behave using daily data from January 07, 1991 to February 25, 2020. The long-run relationships suggest both oil price increases and decreases are significantly and positively related to the prices of all other energy commodities. There seems to be asymmetry in the linkages between oil prices and all the prices of diesel fuel, gasoline, heating oil and natural gas in the long run. Except for natural gas, the effects of oil price increases are significantly larger than those of oil price decreases. However, in the short run, the results are somewhat different. An asymmetric impact of oil price changes is found for gasoline and the effects of oil price decreases are larger than those of oil price increases. In our model, the real effective exchange rate of the US dollar is explicitly incorporated to capture the linkages between US dollar fluctuations and energy price movements. We find that the relative weakness of the US dollar strengthens the prices of energy commodities in the global market. <\/jats:p>","16":"0217-5908,1793-6837"},{"1":"The tail dependence structure between investor sentiment and commodity markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101789","5":"Resources Policy","6":"Resources Policy","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101789","9":"2020 out","10":"19.03840","11":"65","12":"24","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0301-4207"},{"1":"Analysis of dependence structure among investor sentiment, policy uncertainty and international oil prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1504/ijogct.2021.115799","5":"International Journal of Oil, Gas and Coal Technology","6":"IJOGCT","7":"Inderscience Publishers","8":"10.1504/ijogct.2021.115799","9":"2021 jan","10":"19.02349","11":"0","12":"3","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1753-3309,1753-3317"},{"1":"Analysis of dependence structure among investor sentiment, policy uncertainty and international oil prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1504/ijogct.2021.10038718","5":"International Journal of Oil, Gas and Coal Technology","6":"IJOGCT","7":"Inderscience Publishers","8":"10.1504/ijogct.2021.10038718","9":"2021 jan","10":"18.99852","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1753-3309,1753-3317"},{"1":"Forecasting CPI and PPI Using Commodity Prices and Crude Oil Prices: A Comparison of China and United States","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.4236/me.2024.1511055","5":"Modern Economy","6":"ME","7":"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.","8":"10.4236/me.2024.1511055","9":"2024 jan","10":"18.96976","11":"14","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,3]>","15":"NA","16":"2152-7245,2152-7261"},{"1":"Forecasting stock prices with commodity prices: New evidence from Feasible Quasi Generalized Least Squares (FQGLS) with non-linearities","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101043","5":"Economic Systems","6":"Economic Systems","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101043","9":"2023 jun","10":"18.93220","11":"30","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"0939-3625"},{"1":"Conditional feeder cattle hedge ratios: Cross hedging with fluctuating corn prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100193","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100193","9":"2022 jun","10":"18.92734","11":"14","12":"3","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Short- and long-term forecasting of electricity prices using embedding of calendar information in neural networks","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100246","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100246","9":"2022 dez","10":"18.88745","11":"56","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Speculation by Commodity Index Funds","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"monograph","4":"https://doi.org/10.1079/9781800622081.0000","5":"NA","6":"NA","7":"CABI","8":"10.1079/9781800622081.0000","9":"2023 abr","10":"18.84567","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Cross market predictions for commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2020.06.019","5":"Economic Modelling","6":"Economic Modelling","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.econmod.2020.06.019","9":"2020 set","10":"18.80965","11":"38","12":"24","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"0264-9993"},{"1":"Unveiling the Dance of Commodity Prices and the Global Financial Cycle","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400271618.001","5":"IMF Working Papers","6":"NA","7":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","8":"10.5089/9798400271618.001","9":"2024 abr","10":"18.80965","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1018-5941"},{"1":"UNEXPECTED INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND ITS INFLUENCE ON COMMODITY PRICES","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.34286/1995-4638-2021-77-2-99-106","5":"International Scientific Journal","6":"МНЖ","7":"MEGAPOLIS","8":"10.34286/1995-4638-2021-77-2-99-106","9":"2021 jan","10":"18.80596","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1995-4638"},{"1":"Common factors and the dynamics of cereal prices.

We perform a thorough assessment of the forecasting performances of five econometric and machine learning models using 60 years of data. First, we train the models on production and price data to forecast the monthly price variations for each crop separately considering different time horizons. Next, we implement a cross-validation procedure to identify the models with the most accurate forecasting ability for each crop. After choosing the best forecaster, we identify the most influential producing areas using several local and global model-agnostic interpretation tools. Our findings indicate significant differences among commodities in terms of prediction accuracy, with cocoa exhibiting a higher level of prediction error compared to less volatile markets like maize and soybean. Our results reveal a significant influence of Northern America’s maize and soybean production on the global prices of these commodities. The effects of production on prices are asymmetrical: small decreases in US production lead to substantial price increases, while small increases in production do not systematically decrease prices. In contrast, cocoa price variations are influenced by production coming from several regions, not from a single one.<\/jats:p>","16":"1748-9326"},{"1":"The Power of Prices: How Fast Do Commodity Markets Adjust to Shocks?","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400271953.001","5":"IMF Working Papers","6":"NA","7":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","8":"10.5089/9798400271953.001","9":"2024 abr","10":"18.56283","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1018-5941"},{"1":"Global liquidity and commodity prices uncertainty using SFAVEC model","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resglo.2023.100189","5":"Research in Globalization","6":"Research in Globalization","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.resglo.2023.100189","9":"2024 jun","10":"18.55987","11":"47","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2590-051X"},{"1":"An Entropy-based Evaluation for Sentiment Analysis of Stock Market Prices using Twitter Data","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/smap49528.2020.9248440","5":"2020 15th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMA","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/smap49528.2020.9248440","9":"2020 out","10":"18.55221","11":"28","12":"9","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,9]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Forecasting Equity Prices using LSTM and BERT with Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icict57646.2023.10134443","5":"2023 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/icict57646.2023.10134443","9":"2023 abr","10":"18.55221","11":"15","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,9]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Cross-Modal Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_5","5":"Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_5","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.55216","11":"37","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"THE INFLUENCE OF WORLD PRICES ON THE NATIONAL PRICING SYSTEM (COMMODITY MARKETS)","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.47576/2712-7559_2022_3_6_536","5":"Industrial Economics","6":"NA","7":"Publishing house Pegas","8":"10.47576/2712-7559_2022_3_6_536","9":"2022 jan","10":"18.50793","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2712-7559"},{"1":"Global commodity prices and macroeconomic fluctuations in a low interest rate environment","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107114","5":"Energy Economics","6":"Energy Economics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107114","9":"2023 nov","10":"18.50793","11":"59","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"0140-9883"},{"1":"Novel and old news sentiment in commodity futures markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108006","5":"Energy Economics","6":"Energy Economics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108006","9":"2024 dez","10":"18.49219","11":"103","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0140-9883"},{"1":"Commodity dynamism in the COVID-19 crisis: Are gold, oil, and stock commodity prices, symmetrical?","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2022.103033","5":"Resources Policy","6":"Resources Policy","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2022.103033","9":"2022 dez","10":"18.46426","11":"54","12":"35","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0301-4207"},{"1":"Commodity prices and exchange rates: evidence from commodity-dependent developed and emerging economies","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1108/ijoem-08-2020-0954","5":"International Journal of Emerging Markets","6":"IJOEM","7":"Emerald","8":"10.1108/ijoem-08-2020-0954","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.46274","11":"58","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title><jats:p>In this paper the authors examine evidence on exchange rate predictability through commodity prices for a set of countries categorized as commodity import- and export-dependent developed and emerging countries.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach<\/jats:title><jats:p>The authors perform in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting analysis.

A combination of Markov‐switching regressions and quadrivariate VAR–DCC–GARCH and VAR–BEKK–GARCH modeling revealed that external shocks have an asymmetric effect on the relationship of these assets with higher cross‐correlations reported during high volatility regimes. This comovement effect outweighs the substitution effect between energy and agricultural products. Furthermore, the quadrivariate VAR–BEKK–GARCH model provides strong evidence of a bidirectional price volatility spillover between the agricultural and energy markets during periods of high volatility. Overall, the results suggest that energy futures can be effectively used for hedging in a portfolio comprising agricultural futures (and vice versa), while a combination of macroeconomic and financial index futures can serve as an effective hedging tool in investment portfolios comprising both energy and agricultural commodities.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"A quantile autoregression analysis of price volatility in agricultural markets","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12554","5":"Agricultural Economics","6":"Agricultural Economics","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1111/agec.12554","9":"2020 mar","10":"22.82080","11":"37","12":"14","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,7]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This paper investigates the dynamics of agricultural price volatility based on a quantile autoregression (QAR) model. The QAR model provides a flexible representation of the distribution of price and its dynamics. The approach is applied to U.S. wheat and corn markets over the period of 1980–2017. This period is of significant interest as it covers important changes in agricultural policy and increased reliance on markets. The price analysis is conducted conditional on stocks held in the previous period. We show how increasing previous stocks shift the price distribution to the left and decreases the odds of facing price spikes (by shifting down the upper tail of the price distribution). Our analysis also examines the effects of changing public stocks on prices. For both wheat and corn, this reflects changing agricultural policy, contrasting the 1980s (when public stocks were relatively high) with the post‐2005 period (when public stocks became zero). We document how higher public stock ratio during the previous period did not lower the odds of facing price spikes. Applied to the wheat and corn markets, we also uncover evidence of local dynamic instability in the upper tail of the price distribution, suggesting that price instability becomes more pronounced when previous stocks are low.<\/jats:p>","16":"0169-5150,1574-0862"},{"1":"Air pollution, weather factors, and realized volatility forecasts of agricultural commodity futures","2":"<tibble[,7]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22467","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22467","9":"2024 fev","10":"22.65723","11":"64","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study investigates the potential effects of environmental factors on fluctuations in agricultural commodity futures markets, by constructing a new category of daily exogenous predictors related to air pollution, weather, climate change, and investor attention.

Additionally, economic evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of models incorporating investors' attention to climate change or extreme weather as predictors. While not all exogenous predictors are equally important for volatility forecasts, adopting appropriate variable selection methods to handle different sets of exogenous predictors can lead to better performance than the HAR benchmark. With the inclusion of air pollution or weather factors in the HAR model, a portfolio with an annualized average excess return of 16.2068% or a Sharpe ratio of 10.0431 can be achieved for the wheat futures, respectively.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Volatility Level Dependence and Linear-Rational Term Structure Models","2":"<tibble[,8]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1540496x.2022.2059349","5":"Emerging Markets Finance and Trade","6":"Emerging Markets Finance and Trade","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/1540496x.2022.2059349","9":"2022 out","10":"22.50542","11":"33","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1540-496X,1558-0938"},{"1":"Volatility models for cryptocurrencies and applications in the options market","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2021.101421","5":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","6":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.intfin.2021.101421","9":"2021 nov","10":"22.25712","11":"35","12":"15","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"1042-4431"},{"1":"Volatility-of-volatility and the cross-section of option returns","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.finmar.2019.03.002","5":"Journal of Financial Markets","6":"Journal of Financial Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.finmar.2019.03.002","9":"2020 mar","10":"22.22197","11":"40","12":"18","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1386-4181"},{"1":"Forecasting realized volatility: The role of implied volatility, leverage effect, overnight returns, and volatility of realized volatility","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22241","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22241","9":"2021 out","10":"21.92049","11":"62","12":"22","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,7]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>We forecast realized volatility extending the heterogeneous autoregressive model (HAR) to include implied volatility (IV), the leverage effect, overnight returns, and the volatility of realized volatility.

Hybrid ARMA-GARCH models were created for medium- and long-term forecasts of time series of financial market index prices: ARMA models are used to analyze their linear component, which is a combination of autoregressive models and moving average models, and GARCH models are used to analyze the nonlinear component. which are generalized autoregressive models that depend on the nonconstancy of variance models. Hybrid ARMA-GARCH models eliminate the weaknesses and gaps that exist in each group of models (ARMA and GARCH) separately, which increases their forecasting accuracy and reliability, so they have already been successfully applied to model and forecast daily stock returns for three standard indices in the USA. The purpose of this article is to investigate which of the hybrid ARMA-GARCH models is optimal for forecasting the return of the DAX index, which is the most important stock index of the German securities market. It is the German equivalent of the American Dow Jones Index, has been calculated since 1988 by Deutsche Börse AG and reflects the total return on capital of the largest stock companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (currently 40; by 2021 – 30): calculated as a weighted average of capitalization of the value of Free Float share prices on the Xetra electronic exchange, and also takes into account dividends on shares, assuming that the dividend is reinvested in the share on which it was accrued. The database of this study consisted of the daily closing prices of the DAX index presented on the official website of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange during the period from 01.01.2018 to 09.30.2023 (altogether about 1,500 observations), the stability of the time series was assessed using Expanded Dickey Fuller Liquidity (ADF). The article proposes 7 hybrid models, from which the one that is best suited for modeling the volatility of the DAX index is selected. It is an ARMA (2,3)-EGARCH (1,1) model because it captures volatility and leverage effects on DAX returns and its expected returns more than other models. The selection of the best alternative from the developed array of hybrid models was carried out according to the following criteria: AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), H-QIC (Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion).<\/jats:p>","16":"2521-1250,2521-1242"},{"1":"Stochastic Volatility Models Predictive Relevance for Equity Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56219-9_9","5":"Contributions to Statistics,Theory and Applications of Time Series Analysis","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-030-56219-9_9","9":"2020 jan","10":"20.46092","11":"36","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1431-1968"},{"1":"Empirical analysis of rough and classical stochastic volatility models to the SPX and VIX markets","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2022.2081592","5":"Quantitative Finance","6":"Quantitative Finance","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/14697688.2022.2081592","9":"2022 out","10":"20.43534","11":"66","12":"19","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1469-7688,1469-7696"},{"1":"Measuring the Wheat Price Volatility in Global Commodity Market: GARCH Family Models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.21608/jaess.2022.118255.1022","5":"Journal of Agricultural Economics and Social Sciences","6":"Journal of Agricultural Economics and Social Sciences","7":"Egypts Presidential Specialized Council for Education and Scientific Research","8":"10.21608/jaess.2022.118255.1022","9":"2021 dez","10":"20.33411","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2090-3715"},{"1":"Lévy Processes and Stochastic Volatility Models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003263524-2","5":"Pricing Models of Volatility Products and Exotic Variance Derivatives","6":"NA","7":"Chapman and Hall/CRC","8":"10.1201/9781003263524-2","9":"2022 mar","10":"20.22773","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Pricing VIX Futures and Options With Good and Bad Volatility of Volatility","2":"<tibble[,7]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22545","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22545","9":"2024 nov","10":"20.16366","11":"39","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,9]>","15":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT<\/jats:title><jats:p>This article studies the pricing of VIX futures and options by directly modeling the dynamics of VIX, based on realized semivariances computed from high‐frequency data of VIX.

In reality, if investors are unable to achieve efficient diversification, such risk may affect stock returns. The purpose of the study is to examine the presence of idiosyncratic volatility and sentiment in the stock markets of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. Monthly idiosyncratic volatility is estimated using the Fama-French three-factor model. A unified sentiment proxy for each market is created by employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions are applied. F-statistics, t-statistics, and adjusted R2s are used to test the presence of idiosyncratic volatility and sentiment in the GCC markets.Findings show that the effect of sentiment on stock returns is observed across all the GCC markets. Investor sentiment can weakly explain the effect of idiosyncratic volatility on stock returns. In general, investors do not price expected idiosyncratic volatility, and only the unexpected part of it affects stock returns. Overall, the first implication for investors is that they must consider market sentiment to predict the cross-section of stock prices and should not completely ignore the influence of idiosyncratic volatility on stocks. Secondly, the implication for policymakers is that they should motivate companies to go public so that investors have more options to diversify their portfolios across different sectors.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"How far is too far for volatility transmission?","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100198","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100198","9":"2022 jun","10":"19.12511","11":"63","12":"7","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_2","5":"SpringerBriefs in Statistics,Stochastic Volatility and Realized Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_2","9":"2023 jan","10":"19.12184","11":"15","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"2191-544X,2191-5458"},{"1":"Approximate Bayesian Estimation of Stochastic Volatility in Mean Models Using Hidden Markov Models: Empirical Evidence from Emerging and Developed Markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-023-10490-4","5":"Computational Economics","6":"Comput Econ","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s10614-023-10490-4","9":"2024 set","10":"19.10796","11":"42","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0927-7099,1572-9974"},{"1":"An Analysis of Volatility Spillover Effect Between Energy and Agricultural Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67770-0_44","5":"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control,Applications of Optimal Transport to Economics and Related Topics","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Switzerland","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-67770-0_44","9":"2024 jan","10":"19.05073","11":"23","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"2198-4182,2198-4190"},{"1":"Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_3","5":"SpringerBriefs in Statistics,Stochastic Volatility and Realized Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_3","9":"2023 jan","10":"19.00061","11":"24","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2191-544X,2191-5458"},{"1":"Cryptocurrency uncertainty and volatility forecasting of precious metal futures markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100305","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100305","9":"2023 mar","10":"18.98119","11":"43","12":"22","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Realized Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_5","5":"SpringerBriefs in Statistics,Stochastic Volatility and Realized Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_5","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.97007","11":"66","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2191-544X,2191-5458"},{"1":"Volatility spillovers in Australian electricity markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2020.104782","5":"Energy Economics","6":"Energy Economics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eneco.2020.104782","9":"2020 ago","10":"18.96771","11":"85","12":"36","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"0140-9883"},{"1":"Does volatility traverse between emerging and frontier stock markets of Asia?","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.21511/imfi.17(3).2020.07","5":"Investment Management and Financial Innovations","6":"Investment Management and Financial Innovations","7":"LLC CPC Business Perspectives","8":"10.21511/imfi.17(3).2020.07","9":"2020 set","10":"18.82119","11":"28","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:p>Given Asian market recognition at the forefront of the investment domain, the research examines volatility spillover and asymmetric transmission between emerging and frontier stock markets of Asia. Stock returns of two frontier and nine emerging markets, during the data period spanning from August 2000 to March 2020, were analyzed using multivariate asymmetric GARCH-BEKK model around the global financial crisis (GFC). The study results suggest that the structure of cross-markets shocks and volatility spillover between emerging markets are higher during post-GFC. Therefore, this diminishes the possibility of portfolio diversification and investment opportunities to the investors in most of the Asian emerging markets. In the case of Asian frontier markets, most of the volatility generates due to its past shocks and volatility traverse from Asian emerging markets are considerably less. Hence, asset allocations prospects exist in the Asian frontier stock markets. Nevertheless, safe investment strategies need to design to reap diversification benefits from these markets, particularly during financial turmoil and market distress in the future.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Regime-Switching Processes and Mean-Reverting Volatility Models in Value-at-Risk Estimation: Evidence from the Taiwan Stock Index","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1540496x.2019.1609442","5":"Emerging Markets Finance and Trade","6":"Emerging Markets Finance and Trade","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/1540496x.2019.1609442","9":"2020 set","10":"18.80742","11":"48","12":"3","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"NA","16":"1540-496X,1558-0938"},{"1":"Investigating Stock Market Volatility and other Volatility Sources using Stochastic Volatility Models","2":"<NULL>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.18576/amis/180414","5":"Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences","6":"Appl.

Additionally, compared with high volatility network, low volatility network characteristics have greater predictive ability for risk spillover among commodity futures, which means that it contains additional information and provides early warning signals for financial stress.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Volatility Analysis and Volatility Spillover across Equity Markets between India and Major Global Indices","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.52711/2321-5763.2022.00038","5":"Asian Journal of Management","6":"AJM","7":"A and V Publications","8":"10.52711/2321-5763.2022.00038","9":"2022 jul","10":"18.46982","11":"36","12":"3","13":"<NULL>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to study the volatility comparison and volatility spillover effects in India and major global indices. The study uses a vector autoregression model with various GARCH models in order to measure conditional volatility (GARCH), asymmetric effect in the conditional volatility (T-GARCH), volatility persistence in conditional volatility (E-GARCH), the impact of conditional volatility on conditional returns (M-GARCH) and volatility spillover (GARCH (1, 1) with exogenous variable) for the period of 2005 to 2020. The estimates show that the Indian stock market had a strong impact on selected global indices. Volatility spillover was found to be in existence from the Indian stock market to global indices and vice-versa. The T-GARCH estimates show the existence of a significant asymmetric effect in conditional volatility. The results of the E-GARCH estimates show the existence of volatility persistence in conditional volatility and the M-GARCH estimates indicated that there was no significant impact of conditional volatility on conditional returns of the sample indices. These findings have substantial insinuations and outcomes for portfolio managers, analysts, and investors for investment assessments and decisions regarding asset allocations. Higher volatility will lead to a higher level of fretfulness among market participants and investors, which will push them to be more risk-averse. The results of the study are also relevant for policymakers with respect to the Indian as well as global markets. This study will try to add a new dimension to the existing literature by studying how the Indian index has an impact on global indices like Brazil, USA, Russia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea.<\/jats:p>","16":"2321-5763,0976-495X"},{"1":"A Theoretical Framework for Reconceiving Agricultural Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62562-6_2","5":"The Promise of New Agricultural Markets","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Switzerland","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-62562-6_2","9":"2024 jan","10":"18.42246","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Estimation in Gamma-Ornstein –Uhlenbeck Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-03861-7_6","5":"Parameter Estimation in Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-03861-7_6","9":"2022 jan","10":"18.41028","11":"15","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Stochastic Volatility and Realized Stochastic Volatility Models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3","5":"SpringerBriefs in Statistics","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.41028","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2191-544X,2191-5458"},{"1":"Economic Policy Uncertainty and Emerging Stock Market Volatility","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10690-023-09410-1","5":"Asia-Pacific Financial Markets","6":"Asia-Pac Financ Markets","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s10690-023-09410-1","9":"2024 mar","10":"18.39444","11":"65","12":"7","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1387-2834,1573-6946"},{"1":"Firm fundamentals and the cross-section of implied volatility shapes","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.finmar.2022.100771","5":"Journal of Financial Markets","6":"Journal of Financial Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.finmar.2022.100771","9":"2023 mar","10":"18.38210","11":"78","12":"4","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"1386-4181"},{"1":"Investigating volatility transmission across international equity markets using multivariate fractional models","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.12894","5":"International Transactions in Operational Research","6":"Int Trans Operational Res","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1111/itor.12894","9":"2023 set","10":"18.34551","11":"56","12":"5","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,6]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The growing number of cross‐listed stocks has significantly contributed to the integration of national economies over the last few decades, and has consequently strengthened the interdependence between international stock markets. This phenomenon has sparked a fervent debate in academia and in decision‐making circles dealing with volatility spillovers between international stock prices. Accordingly, isolated examinations of single foreign cross‐listing markets appear inadequate. On this basis, the aim of this article is to recognize volatility transmission patterns within international equity markets using a unique and comprehensive sample of highly traded companies simultaneously cross‐listed in the United States and the UK. An important fact to be noted here is that long‐range dependence is statistically proved in the studied cases, which means that the efficient market hypothesis is utterly rejected. Therefore, a multivariate fractionally co‐integrated model is preliminarily used to fit various samples of high‐frequency time series. Resulting residuals are then subject to a deeper analysis, allowing us to reveal significant volatility transmissions between markets of multiple cross‐listed stocks. Causality experiments are finally conducted on processed data. The results show strong bi‐directional volatility causations between various marketplaces. The overall deduction of this work is that price discovery takes place essentially in local and British markets, thus implying a satellite role in the price discovery process for American exchanges.<\/jats:p>","16":"0969-6016,1475-3995"},{"1":"Smile‐implied hedging with volatility risk","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22191","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22191","9":"2021 ago","10":"18.33447","11":"42","12":"6","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Options can be dynamically replicated using model‐free Greeks extracted from the volatility smile.

The VAR and bivariate GARCH BEKK models were employed. The study results suggest that before the Brexit referendum, Indian stock market returns made no significant return spillover on the other markets. On the contrary, following the referendum, Indian stock returns significantly spilled over to France, Germany, the UK, and the USA stock market returns. The study results also identified a substantial increase in the bidirectional volatility spillover between India-France, India-UK, and India-USA during the post-Brexit referendum period. Therefore, the investors’ opportunity to invest simultaneously in India, UK, EU, and US stock markets for portfolio diversification is limited. India was affected mainly by its own past shocks before the Brexit referendum. However, after the Brexit referendum, Indian markets are getting more and more integrated with other markets.

Our findings are robust to alternative VOV risk measures and forecasting horizons.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Jump and volatility risk in the cross-section of corporate bond returns","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.finmar.2022.100733","5":"Journal of Financial Markets","6":"Journal of Financial Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.finmar.2022.100733","9":"2022 set","10":"18.01743","11":"61","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1386-4181"},{"1":"Volatility and Specific Risk Toward Family’s Performance in an Emerging Country","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10690-019-09297-x","5":"Asia-Pacific Financial Markets","6":"Asia-Pac Financ Markets","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s10690-019-09297-x","9":"2020 set","10":"18.01743","11":"57","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1387-2834,1573-6946"},{"1":"Monetary policy shocks and stock market volatility in emerging markets","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.22495/rgcv10i3p4","5":"Risk Governance and Control: Financial Markets and Institutions","6":"RGC","7":"Virtus Interpress","8":"10.22495/rgcv10i3p4","9":"2020 jan","10":"17.98968","11":"109","12":"4","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:p>This paper examines the effect of monetary policy decisions on stock markets in emerging economies particularly South Africa for the period 2000Q1 to 2016Q4. This is important as the monetary authorities would understand how their decisions may cause reactions to the stock market. Monetary policy directly shocks money supply and repo rate and indirectly GDP and inflation among many macroeconomic variables. A hypothesis that stock markets do not respond to monetary policy determinations is formulated and tested using a two-stage approach by employing first the vector error correction model to determine the long-run relationship of the variables and secondly GARCH (1, 2) model to determine the volatility. And the results suggest that about 5.2% variations in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) volatility are due to monetary policy shocks. Overall, there is a negative relationship between M2 and stock market volatility. However, there is a positive link between repo rate and JSE volatility, which is not economically preferable because variations in repo rate influence the aggregate demand of investment on securities. The study recommends that the Monetary Policy Committee an expansionary monetary policy of keeping the repo rate lower must be pursued in order to increase borrowing that makes the public to have money to make transactions in securities on the financial market.<\/jats:p>","16":"2077-4303,2077-429X"},{"1":"Power‐type derivatives for rough volatility with jumps","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22337","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22337","9":"2022 jul","10":"17.97087","11":"63","12":"4","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This paper proposes a novel analytical pricing–hedging framework for volatility derivatives which simultaneously takes into account rough volatility and volatility jumps.

Pricing–hedging formulae are proposed for a general class of power‐type derivatives, in the spirit of numerical Fourier transform. A comparative empirical study is conducted on two independent recent data sets on Volatility Index options, before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic, to demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly amenable to efficient model calibration under various choices of kernels.

The main contribution of this paper is the use of very long time series. It is important to use longer span data because it offers more powerful econometric results. To detect episodes of potential explosive behavior in house prices over this long period, we use the recursive unit root tests for explosiveness proposed by Phillips et al. (2011), (2015a,b). According to the results, there is a clear speculative bubble behavior in real house prices between 1997 and 2020, speculative process that has not yet been adjusted.<\/jats:p>","16":"1864-6042"},{"1":"Study on the cointegration relationship between water supply and demand in the irrigation district with structural breaks","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107196","5":"Agricultural Water Management","6":"Agricultural Water Management","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107196","9":"2021 dez","10":"21.15953","11":"41","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0378-3774"},{"1":"Change in agricultural commodity prices due to 25% increase in fertiliser prices","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/211a5954-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/211a5954-en","9":"2023 jul","10":"20.03521","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"A CEEMD-ARIMA-SVM model with structural breaks to forecast the crude oil prices linked with extreme events","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-07276-5","5":"Soft Computing","6":"Soft Comput","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s00500-022-07276-5","9":"2022 set","10":"19.97431","11":"64","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1432-7643,1433-7479"},{"1":"Modeling Returns and Volatility Transmission from Crude Oil Prices to Leone-US Dollar Exchange Rate in Sierra Leone: A GARCH Approach with Structural Breaks","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.4236/me.2021.123029","5":"Modern Economy","6":"ME","7":"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.","8":"10.4236/me.2021.123029","9":"2021 jan","10":"19.92848","11":"36","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"NA","16":"2152-7245,2152-7261"},{"1":"Oil Prices and Exchange Rate Dynamics: How Important Is the Role of Asymmetry and Structural Breaks?","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15228916.2021.1909401","5":"Journal of African Business","6":"Journal of African Business","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/15228916.2021.1909401","9":"2022 jul","10":"19.92848","11":"51","12":"11","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1522-8916,1522-9076"},{"1":"The evolution of biofuel prices and biofuel feedstock prices","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/67a46bc6-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2020-2029","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/67a46bc6-en","9":"2020 jul","10":"19.53741","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Consumer Prices Trends in Colombia: Detecting Breaks and Forecasting Inflation","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"report","4":"https://doi.org/10.32468/be.1289","5":"NA","6":"NA","7":"Banco de la República","8":"10.32468/be.1289","9":"2024 dez","10":"19.53436","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"<jats:p>Colombia’s annual inflation reached 13.3% in March 2023, the highest rate since the implementation of the inflation-targeting regime for monetary policy in 2000. However, some groups within the basket show signs of lower inflation, while others exhibit higher inflation. The persistence of this trend is actively debated, involving analysis of both year-to-year and month-to-month changes in price indices.\\nIn this paper, we use a time series methodology to identify shifts in inflation levels based on the 188 price indices that comprise the basket. We classify the trend breaks as positive or negative and aggregate them by tradable and non-tradable, core and regulated, and other CPI groups.\\nAdditionally, we employ these trend models, possibly with breaks, to forecast total (bottom-up and middle-up approaches) and group inflation for 2024. Our findings suggest that inflation will decline for most groups by the end of 2024 but will increase for some key groups.

Since these countries play a crucial role in the international economy, it is important for financial market participants to understand the volatility transmission process for designing optimal portfolio allocations. We examine weekly data over the period 1998–2017 and endogenously detect structural breaks in variance using an iterated algorithm in order to estimate the volatility dynamics with greater accuracy. The models were estimated using the maximum likelihood method, and the BFGS algorithm was employed to obtain the variance–covariance estimation and the corresponding standard errors. Overall, we find volatility spillovers between markets together with the fact that the oil market has a leading role. More importantly, we show that neglecting structural changes in variance and/or asymmetries may lead to biased volatility spillover effects. Furthermore, the results highlight that models ignoring structural breaks are significantly overestimating the effect of their own past volatility on the current volatility. In addition, we find that disregarding asymmetries could also lead to erroneous estimates of these effects. Finally, we compute dynamic risk‐minimizing hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights, however, no significant discrepancies are found among the models considered.<\/jats:p>","16":"1076-9307,1099-1158"},{"1":"U.S. House Prices by Census Division: Persistence, Trends and Structural Breaks","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11294-023-09868-9","5":"International Advances in Economic Research","6":"Int Adv Econ Res","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s11294-023-09868-9","9":"2023 mai","10":"18.79720","11":"23","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract\\n<\/jats:title><jats:p>This paper uses fractional integration methods to examine persistence, trends and structural breaks in United States house prices, more specifically the monthly Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index for census divisions, and the United States as a whole over the period from January 1991 to August 2022. The full sample estimates imply that the order of integration of the series is above one in all cases, and is particularly high for the aggregate series, implying high levels of persistence. However, when the possibility of structural breaks is taken into account, segmented trends are detected. The subsample estimates of the fractional differencing parameter tend to be lower, with mean reversion occurring in a number of cases. This means that shocks in the series are expected to be transitory in these subsamples, disappearing in the long run by themselves. In addition, the time trend coefficient is at its highest in the last subsample, which in most cases starts around May 2020 coincident with the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The results provide clear evidence of differences between census divisions, which implies that appropriate housing policies should be designed at the local (rather than at the federal)

Against this backdrop, the present study empirically examines the effect of stock futures on the underlying stock’s volatility in India by incorporating the structural breaks with the help of ICSS test and AR (1)-GARCH (1, 1) model for 30 most liquid and actively traded underlying stocks and their associated futures contracts. The study period ranges from the 1st January 2000 or the listing date of the particular stock (whichever is prior) till 31st March 2019. The study contributes to the on-going debate regarding the effect of derivatives on the underlying stock market’s volatility in two ways. Firstly, by taking into consideration the breaks in the volatility and, secondly, studying the effect of single stock futures will allow us to evaluate company-specific response to futures trading directly. The study offers a mixed outcome for the stocks under consideration. However, there is evidence of a decline in unconditional volatility for the majority of the stocks. The overall findings indicate that trading in stock futures may not have any detrimental effect on the underlying stock’s volatility.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Breaks, trends and correlations in commodity prices in the very long-run","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.105933","5":"Energy Economics","6":"Energy Economics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eneco.2022.105933","9":"2022 abr","10":"17.62836","11":"96","12":"7","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0140-9883"},{"1":"Measuring the synchronisation of agricultural prices: co-movement of cycles in pig and cattle prices in Brazil, Chile and Uruguay","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbab015","5":"European Review of Agricultural Economics","6":"NA","7":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","8":"10.1093/erae/jbab015","9":"2022 jun","10":"17.57733","11":"54","12":"3","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>Simultaneous spikes in global prices of many agricultural commodities in recent years have induced an interest in quantifying the degree of synchronisation of these movements. We suggest a conceptual framework explaining why temporally varying price synchronisation may happen and propose the concordance index for the empirical measurement of the incidence, symmetry and permanence of synchronisation. We establish that the index generates insights into time series dynamics which are complementary to those obtained from cointegration analysis. We illustrate the approach with an application for the co-movement in cyclical components of pig and cattle prices in three Latin American countries.

study analyses the asymmetric effects of the swings in diesel prices and exchange rates on Turkey’s food prices with the Non-Linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. For this purpose, Turkey’s diesel prices, exchange rate, and general food price index data for the same period between January 2000 and December 2019 were adopted. Considering that diesel prices are an essential cost item in agricultural production, it becomes crucial to determine the effect on food prices. Besides, the exchange rate fluctuations are expressed as another important macro variable that impacts food prices. As a result of the NARDL model, asymmetric co-integration between the general food price index, diesel prices, and the exchange rate was determined. Still, it has been observed that the negative and positive changes in diesel prices on food prices, in the long run, do not have a significant effect. On the other hand, the negative effect of the exchange rate was significant. It is concluded that a 1% decrease in the negative changes in the exchange rate will cause 0.94% decrease in food prices. Consequently, the general food price is affected by adverse shocks on the exchange rate in the long run. One may be concluded that the exchange rate should be considered while formulating policies about the swings in food prices. Especially, the local production of agricultural inputs affected by exchange rate fluctuations could be encouraged.<\/jats:p>","16":"0552-9034,2076-0906"},{"1":"Long-term evolution of commodity prices, in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/61f839cc-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/61f839cc-en","9":"2022 jun","10":"16.68241","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Long-term evolution of commodity prices, in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/694365b0-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/694365b0-en","9":"2021 jul","10":"16.68241","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Predicting Agricultural Product and Supplies Prices Using Artificial Intelligence","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5220/0013071600003838","5":"Proceedings of the 16th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management","6":"NA","7":"SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications","8":"10.5220/0013071600003838","9":"2024 jan","10":"16.66592","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"The Impacts of Covid-19: An Econometric Analysis of Crude Oil Prices and Rice Prices in the World","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.47059/alinteri/v35i2/ajas20085","5":"Alinteri Journal of Agricultural Sciences","6":"alinteri","7":"Centivens Institute of Innovative Research","8":"10.47059/alinteri/v35i2/ajas20085","9":"2020 nov","10":"16.60384","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2587-2249"},{"1":"Inference for Structural Breaks in Spatial Models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202020.0342","5":"Statistica Sinica","6":"STAT SINICA","7":"Statistica Sinica (Institute of Statistical Science)","8":"10.5705/ss.202020.0342","9":"2023 jan","10":"16.58181","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1017-0405"},{"1":"Figure 3.11 Prices of traded foods by processing level, 2021","2":"<NULL>","3":"dataset","4":"https://doi.org/10.4060/10.4060/cd2144en-fig3.11","5":"The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2024","6":"NA","7":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","8":"10.4060/10.4060/cd2144en-fig3.11","9":"2024 nov","10":"16.44200","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Figure 3.10 Import prices of food categories across countries, 2021","2":"<NULL>","3":"dataset","4":"https://doi.org/10.4060/cd2144en-fig3.10","5":"The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2024","6":"NA","7":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","8":"10.4060/cd2144en-fig3.10","9":"2024 nov","10":"16.43368","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Governments Messing with Prices and Agricultural Subsidies","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003308225-13","5":"Environmental Economics and Ecosystem Services","6":"NA","7":"Routledge","8":"10.4324/9781003308225-13","9":"2024 dez","10":"16.40954","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Structural Breaks in Carbon Emissions: A Machine Learning Analysis","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400200267.001","5":"IMF Working Papers","6":"NA","7":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","8":"10.5089/9798400200267.001","9":"2022 jan","10":"16.37121","11":"0","12":"4","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1018-5941"},{"1":"Structural breaks in seemingly unrelated regression models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1365100523000329","5":"Macroeconomic Dynamics","6":"Macroecon.

The proposed method is a weighted average of two estimators: a restricted estimator that estimates the parameters under the restriction of no break in the coefficients, and an unrestricted estimator that considers break points and estimates the parameters using the observations within each regime. It is established that the asymptotic risk of the Stein-like shrinkage estimator is smaller than that of the unrestricted estimator, which is the method typically used to estimate the slope coefficients under structural breaks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an averaging minimal mean squared error estimator in which the averaging weight is derived by minimizing its asymptotic risk.

The grain is considered as “super grain” due to its nutritional qualities, and it has seen an increase in its demand and price in recent years. These trends raise public concerns about the affordability of the grain and the prevalence of food insecurity in Ethiopia. Therefore, we investigate the impacts of increasing teff prices on consumers’ welfare by regions. Using data from two waves of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey 2013–2014 and 2015–2016, we examine the consumption patterns of cereals in Ethiopia and estimate a two‐stage structural demand system. We find that teff is the most own‐price inelastic grain in Ethiopia and an increase of 10% in teff prices will reduce consumer welfare by 0.81, 1.29, and 1.73 Birrs per week for the average rural, town, and urban consumers, respectively. These estimates correspond to 1.64, 2.31, and 2.46% of their weekly food budgets. We also find the negative effects of an increase in teff prices are smaller for the lower‐income groups as they have relatively lower expenditures on teff. Additionally, we analyze the effects of simultaneous changes in wheat and teff prices to measure the extent to which Ethiopia's food policy of distributing subsidized wheat could offset the consumer welfare loss due to an increase in teff prices.<\/jats:p>","16":"0169-5150,1574-0862"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Czech Republic","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/0d675ad7-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/0d675ad7-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.03797","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Production (gross output), current prices: Norway","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/05476d39-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/05476d39-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.03797","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Production (gross output), current prices: Austria","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/5498d0be-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/5498d0be-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.03797","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"World reference prices for meat -rising in nominal, but falling in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/9f412d4e-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/9f412d4e-en","9":"2022 jun","10":"16.02449","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"World reference prices for meat -rising in nominal, but falling in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/697c3f4a-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/697c3f4a-en","9":"2021 jul","10":"16.02298","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"World reference prices for meat ‒ rising in nominal, but falling in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/eebdf81e-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/eebdf81e-en","9":"2023 jul","10":"16.01448","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"World reference prices for meat -rising in nominal, but falling in real terms","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/d6f0e225-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2024-2033","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/d6f0e225-en","9":"2024 jul","10":"15.98991","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Production (gross output), current prices: United Kingdom","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/1fa98bf4-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/1fa98bf4-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.95286","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Structural Breaks in an Endogenous Growth Model","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdab045","5":"The Review of Economic Studies","6":"NA","7":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","8":"10.1093/restud/rdab045","9":"2022 mar","10":"15.93712","11":"61","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>We study the effects of parameter uncertainty prompted by structural breaks.

This is because lifetime utility varies more when shocks shift beliefs and perceived wealth.<\/jats:p>","16":"0034-6527,1467-937X"},{"1":"An empirically sufficient form for Sraffa prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2023.10.017","5":"Structural Change and Economic Dynamics","6":"Structural Change and Economic Dynamics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.strueco.2023.10.017","9":"2024 jun","10":"15.89597","11":"25","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0954-349X"},{"1":"Sraffa’s ‘Reduction’ of the prices of basics","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2021.10.011","5":"Structural Change and Economic Dynamics","6":"Structural Change and Economic Dynamics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.strueco.2021.10.011","9":"2021 dez","10":"15.89397","11":"27","12":"5","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0954-349X"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Switzerland","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/4b8ac257-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/4b8ac257-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.89397","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Austria","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/4e67bc0e-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/4e67bc0e-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.89397","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Portugal","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/39549086-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/39549086-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.89397","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Norway","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/31227656-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/31227656-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.86946","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Latvia","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/486ec44a-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/486ec44a-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.86946","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Denmark","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/53c766dc-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/53c766dc-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.86446","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Gross fixed capital formation, current prices: Germany","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/1361b108-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/1361b108-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"15.86446","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Trade credit and agricultural commodity prices: evidence from the us dairy industry","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbac010","5":"European Review of Agricultural Economics","6":"NA","7":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","8":"10.1093/erae/jbac010","9":"2023 mar","10":"15.85029","11":"83","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Financing provided by suppliers or trade credit is a major source of short-term finance.

However, the evidence supporting the cost-push theory of inflation over extended periods is inconclusive and lacks direct quantification. To address this gap, we employ structural break and causality tests, regression analysis, and local projection impulse-response functions. Our analysis allows us to precisely identify instances when producer prices lead consumer prices and quantify short-run and long-run pass-through rates. We find relatively robust evidence of a producer price pass-through rate between 8 and 12%. However, there are significant periods where unidirectional pass-through does not hold. Local projections reveal that producer price pass-through is small but persistent in states where producer prices lead consumer prices, and larger but shorter-lived in states where there is no causal directionality. Our findings enhance the understanding of producer price pass-through to consumer inflation, providing valuable insights for policymakers and market participants interested in accurately forecasting and managing inflationary pressures.<\/jats:p>","16":"1864-6042"},{"1":"Detection of internal tendon breaks by fiber-optical measurements – influence of the re-anchoring behavior","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostr.2024.09.199","5":"Procedia Structural Integrity","6":"Procedia Structural Integrity","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.prostr.2024.09.199","9":"2024 jan","10":"15.73593","11":"24","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,7]>","15":"NA","16":"2452-3216"},{"1":"Tax Reforms, Structural Breaks, and Dynamics of Tax Revenue in Fiji","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1353/jda.2023.a907743","5":"The Journal of Developing Areas","6":"jda","7":"Project MUSE","8":"10.1353/jda.2023.a907743","9":"2023 jun","10":"15.73321","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> ABSTRACT: The changing dynamics of tax revenue and its responses to domestic and external shocks play a pivotal role in the discussion of the sustainability of public finance in small developing economies. However, the empirical literature on the response of tax revenue to various shocks in developing economies in the Pacific is sparse. Despite several tax reforms over the last decade, the spending plans of the Fijian government since the 2017/2018 budget announcements have stimulated frequent public discussions regarding the sustainability of public debt. Against this background, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the response of tax revenue in Fiji - a small developing island economy, to external and domestic shocks using historical annual data covering more than five decades. This study uses unit root tests that account for single and multiple endogenous structural breaks and finds that tax revenue in Fiji is a non-stationary process, I (1) with break dates coinciding with tax reforms, general elections, and political coups. The findings reveal that tax reforms and political developments are possible important sources of shocks to tax revenue and have important policy implications. First, shocks to tax revenue will have persistent effects, with the effects of adverse shocks being transmitted to other related variables and sectors of the Fijian economy. Second, historical values of tax revenue cannot be used to formulate forecasts of tax revenue and policymakers should consider other determinants of tax revenue (for example, the share of the agriculture sector, trade volume, political stability, education, life expectancy, infant mortality rates, age composition of the population, urbanization, inflation rate, and corruption) for forecasting purposes. The evidence of non-stationarity indicates that future studies on tax revenue need to carefully reflect on the modeling technique to avoid spurious regressions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that temporary fiscal measures will not have a permanent effect on tax revenue and sustainable revenue growth requires focusing on long-term (rather than short-sighted) reforms. Thus, our findings underscore the importance of evidence-based policy reforms to improve the resilience, efficiency, and sustainability of the tax system in Fiji to shelter it from future adverse shocks.<\/jats:p>","16":"1548-2278"},{"1":"The dynamic impact of international agricultural commodity price fluctuation on Chinese agricultural commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.22434/ifamr2019.0172","5":"International Food and Agribusiness Management Review","6":"IFAM","7":"Brill","8":"10.22434/ifamr2019.0172","9":"2020 set","10":"15.73113","11":"28","12":"9","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"<jats:p>The correlation between Chinese and international commodity prices may be nonlinear because of China’s minimum agricultural commodity purchase price policy and temporary storage policy.

Our empirical results reveal that a unidirectional causal relation exists between international and Chinese prices for soybeans and corn; specifically, international prices of soybeans and corn Granger-cause Chinese prices of soybeans and corn.

article studies exchange-traded funds’ (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF-dominated asset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. I propose a new way to measure ETF-related price distortions based on the specifics of futures contracts. This allows me to isolate a component in VIX futures prices that is strongly related to the rebalancing of ETFs. I derive a novel decomposition of ETF trading demand into leverage rebalancing, calendar rebalancing, and flow rebalancing, and show that trading against ETFs is risky. Leverage rebalancing has the largest effects on the ETF-related price component. This rebalancing amplifies price changes and exposes ETF counterparties to variance.<\/jats:p>","16":"1572-3097,1573-692X"},{"1":"Welfare impacts of increasing teff prices on Ethiopian consumers","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12614","5":"Agricultural Economics","6":"Agricultural Economics","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1111/agec.12614","9":"2021 mar","10":"16.03900","11":"41","12":"6","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Teff is an ancient grain primarily produced in Ethiopia and providing more than 10% of the total calories consumed in the country. The grain is considered as “super grain” due to its nutritional qualities, and it has seen an increase in its demand and price in recent years. These trends raise public concerns about the affordability of the grain and the prevalence of food insecurity in Ethiopia. Therefore, we investigate the impacts of increasing teff prices on consumers’ welfare by regions. Using data from two waves of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey 2013–2014 and 2015–2016, we examine the consumption patterns of cereals in Ethiopia and estimate a two‐stage structural demand system. We find that teff is the most own‐price inelastic grain in Ethiopia and an increase of 10% in teff prices will reduce consumer welfare by 0.81, 1.29, and 1.73 Birrs per week for the average rural, town, and urban consumers, respectively. These estimates correspond to 1.64, 2.31, and 2.46% of their weekly food budgets. We also find the negative effects of an increase in teff prices are smaller for the lower‐income groups as they have relatively lower expenditures on teff. Additionally, we analyze the effects of simultaneous changes in wheat and teff prices to measure the extent to which Ethiopia's food policy of distributing subsidized wheat could offset the consumer welfare loss due to an increase in teff prices.<\/jats:p>","16":"0169-5150,1574-0862"},{"1":"Warehouse load-out queues and aluminum prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100243","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100243","9":"2022 dez","10":"21.68193","11":"56","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Volatility‐of‐volatility risk in the crude oil market","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22166","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22166","9":"2021 fev","10":"18.02035","11":"49","12":"9","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This paper examines the role of oil volatility‐of‐volatility (VOV) risk under a stochastic VOV framework.

The study uses a vector autoregression model with various GARCH models in order to measure conditional volatility (GARCH), asymmetric effect in the conditional volatility (T-GARCH), volatility persistence in conditional volatility (E-GARCH), the impact of conditional volatility on conditional returns (M-GARCH) and volatility spillover (GARCH (1, 1) with exogenous variable) for the period of 2005 to 2020. The estimates show that the Indian stock market had a strong impact on selected global indices. Volatility spillover was found to be in existence from the Indian stock market to global indices and vice-versa. The T-GARCH estimates show the existence of a significant asymmetric effect in conditional volatility. The results of the E-GARCH estimates show the existence of volatility persistence in conditional volatility and the M-GARCH estimates indicated that there was no significant impact of conditional volatility on conditional returns of the sample indices. These findings have substantial insinuations and outcomes for portfolio managers, analysts, and investors for investment assessments and decisions regarding asset allocations. Higher volatility will lead to a higher level of fretfulness among market participants and investors, which will push them to be more risk-averse. The results of the study are also relevant for policymakers with respect to the Indian as well as global markets. This study will try to add a new dimension to the existing literature by studying how the Indian index has an impact on global indices like Brazil, USA, Russia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea.<\/jats:p>","16":"2321-5763,0976-495X"},{"1":"Volatility Analysis Based on ARMA-GARCH-type Models -Evidence from Chinese CSI300 Spot, Futures and ETF Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.36527/kcsss.21.1.5","5":"Korean-Chinese Social Science Studies","6":"KCSSS","7":"Korea-China Social Science Association","8":"10.36527/kcsss.21.1.5","9":"2023 jan","10":"19.73970","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1738-0456"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Slovak Republic","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/02fce81c-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/02fce81c-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.11807","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Portugal","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/56a920a6-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/56a920a6-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24735","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Norway","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/2f21702c-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/2f21702c-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24735","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Mexico","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/050b0732-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/050b0732-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.30529","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Lithuania","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/29f6a0ff-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/29f6a0ff-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24428","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Estonia","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/3ba9bc32-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/3ba9bc32-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24735","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Denmark","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/4360ce7e-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/4360ce7e-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24428","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Czech Republic","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/0d675ad7-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/0d675ad7-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.03797","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Value added, current prices: Australia","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/43b240e2-en","5":"STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics,STAN: OECD Structural Analysis Statistics 2020","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/43b240e2-en","9":"2020 ago","10":"16.24735","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2225-2169"},{"1":"Valuation of VIX and target volatility options with affine GARCH models","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22157","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22157","9":"2020 dez","10":"21.58431","11":"45","12":"16","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>In this paper we propose semiclosed‐form solutions, subject to an inversion of the Fourier transform, for the price of VIX options and target volatility options under affine GARCH models based on Gaussian and Inverse Gaussian distributions.

However, the evidence supporting the cost-push theory of inflation over extended periods is inconclusive and lacks direct quantification. To address this gap, we employ structural break and causality tests, regression analysis, and local projection impulse-response functions. Our analysis allows us to precisely identify instances when producer prices lead consumer prices and quantify short-run and long-run pass-through rates. We find relatively robust evidence of a producer price pass-through rate between 8 and 12%. However, there are significant periods where unidirectional pass-through does not hold. Local projections reveal that producer price pass-through is small but persistent in states where producer prices lead consumer prices, and larger but shorter-lived in states where there is no causal directionality. Our findings enhance the understanding of producer price pass-through to consumer inflation, providing valuable insights for policymakers and market participants interested in accurately forecasting and managing inflationary pressures.<\/jats:p>","16":"1864-6042"},{"1":"Unit roots in real primary commodity prices?

The full sample estimates imply that the order of integration of the series is above one in all cases, and is particularly high for the aggregate series, implying high levels of persistence. However, when the possibility of structural breaks is taken into account, segmented trends are detected. The subsample estimates of the fractional differencing parameter tend to be lower, with mean reversion occurring in a number of cases. This means that shocks in the series are expected to be transitory in these subsamples, disappearing in the long run by themselves. In addition, the time trend coefficient is at its highest in the last subsample, which in most cases starts around May 2020 coincident with the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The results provide clear evidence of differences between census divisions, which implies that appropriate housing policies should be designed at the local (rather than at the federal) level.<\/jats:p>","16":"1083-0898,1573-966X"},{"1":"Turkey’s markets will face high short term volatility","2":"<NULL>","3":"report-component","4":"https://doi.org/10.1108/oxan-es279181","5":"Emerald Expert Briefings","6":"NA","7":"Emerald","8":"10.1108/oxan-es279181","9":"2023 mai","10":"18.09946","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"<jats:sec sec-type=\"headline\">\\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Headline<\/jats:title>\\n               <jats:p>TURKEY: Markets will face high short term volatility <\/jats:p>\\n            <\/jats:sec>","16":"2633-304X"},{"1":"Turbulence on Financial Markets and a Model of a Multiplicative Cascade of Volatility","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1134/s2070048221040177","5":"Mathematical Models and Computer Simulations","6":"Math Models Comput Simul","7":"Pleiades Publishing Ltd","8":"10.1134/s2070048221040177","9":"2021 jul","10":"21.25497","11":"30","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2070-0482,2070-0490"},{"1":"Trends, Cycles, and Structural Breaks in Cliometrics","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-35583-7_21","5":"Handbook of Cliometrics","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-35583-7_21","9":"2024 jan","10":"17.57650","11":"68","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Trade fragmentation and volatility-of-volatility networks","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101908","5":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","6":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101908","9":"2024 mar","10":"20.97309","11":"89","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1042-4431"},{"1":"Trade credit and agricultural commodity prices: evidence from the us dairy industry","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbac010","5":"European Review of Agricultural Economics","6":"NA","7":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","8":"10.1093/erae/jbac010","9":"2023 mar","10":"15.85029","11":"83","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Financing provided by suppliers or trade credit is a major source of short-term finance.

To capture different effects on the transmission mechanism of uncertainty shocks, we implement a Bayesian VAR approach, which accounts for time-variation in the coefficients and the variance covariance structure of the model’s innovations. The results point in favor of a time-dependent uncertainty effect on expectations of daily momentum traders in agricultural futures markets. The corresponding trades in these periods push futures prices upwards and downwards and result in an increased volatility.

Moreover, our empirical finding provides strong evidence that the total spillover index can be used as an early warning of the rise of uncertainty in South Korea and China, especially during crisis periods.

The results show significant transmission from oil and food prices to domestic inflation. Specifically, the food prices are shown more important than oil prices in explaining inflation in the short-run, which reflects the high weight of food in the consumption basket. However, the effect of oil prices on inflation is much more persistent than the effect of food prices. Furthermore, the impact of commodity price shocks on inflation exhibits asymmetries. The oil price hikes affect more weakly the inflation than oil price decreases, whereas the food price increases are more transmitted to inflation than food price decreases. Our findings may provide useful information to researchers and policymakers in formulating more appropriate monetary policy.<\/jats:p>","16":"2501-3165,2501-1960"},{"1":"The Problem of Sentiment Analysis","2":"<NULL>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108639286.003","5":"Sentiment Analysis","6":"NA","7":"Cambridge University Press","8":"10.1017/9781108639286.003","9":"2020 out","10":"18.44697","11":"1514","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"The Predictive Power of Oil and Commodity Prices for Equity Markets","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1142/9789811210242_0003","5":"Risk Factors and Contagion in Commodity Markets and Stocks Markets","6":"NA","7":"WORLD SCIENTIFIC","8":"10.1142/9789811210242_0003","9":"2020 jun","10":"19.59711","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"The Power of Prices: How Fast Do Commodity Markets Adjust to Shocks?","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400271953.001","5":"IMF Working Papers","6":"NA","7":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","8":"10.5089/9798400271953.001","9":"2024 abr","10":"18.56283","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1018-5941"},{"1":"The Link Between Higher Commodity Prices and Inflation","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.20955/es.2021.22","5":"Economic Synopses","6":"es","7":"Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis","8":"10.20955/es.2021.22","9":"2021 jan","10":"20.43145","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"The Impacts of Covid-19: An Econometric Analysis of Crude Oil Prices and Rice Prices in the World","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.47059/alinteri/v35i2/ajas20085","5":"Alinteri Journal of Agricultural Sciences","6":"alinteri","7":"Centivens Institute of Innovative Research","8":"10.47059/alinteri/v35i2/ajas20085","9":"2020 nov","10":"16.60384","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2587-2249"},{"1":"The Establishment of Commodity Success Model Based on Text Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/bigdia51454.2020.00036","5":"2020 6th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/bigdia51454.2020.00036","9":"2020 dez","10":"19.70582","11":"16","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,9]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"The Dynamics of Commodity Prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003265399-22","5":"Commodities","6":"NA","7":"Chapman and Hall/CRC","8":"10.1201/9781003265399-22","9":"2022 out","10":"19.32353","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Testing for regime-switching behaviour in Finnish agricultural land prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1108/afr-03-2020-0037","5":"Agricultural Finance Review","6":"AFR","7":"Emerald","8":"10.1108/afr-03-2020-0037","9":"2020 jul","10":"16.19074","11":"32","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,13]>","15":"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study analyses agricultural land price dynamics in order to better understand price development and to improve forecast accuracy.

However, the empirical literature on the response of tax revenue to various shocks in developing economies in the Pacific is sparse. Despite several tax reforms over the last decade, the spending plans of the Fijian government since the 2017/2018 budget announcements have stimulated frequent public discussions regarding the sustainability of public debt. Against this background, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the response of tax revenue in Fiji - a small developing island economy, to external and domestic shocks using historical annual data covering more than five decades. This study uses unit root tests that account for single and multiple endogenous structural breaks and finds that tax revenue in Fiji is a non-stationary process, I (1) with break dates coinciding with tax reforms, general elections, and political coups. The findings reveal that tax reforms and political developments are possible important sources of shocks to tax revenue and have important policy implications. First, shocks to tax revenue will have persistent effects, with the effects of adverse shocks being transmitted to other related variables and sectors of the Fijian economy. Second, historical values of tax revenue cannot be used to formulate forecasts of tax revenue and policymakers should consider other determinants of tax revenue (for example, the share of the agriculture sector, trade volume, political stability, education, life expectancy, infant mortality rates, age composition of the population, urbanization, inflation rate, and corruption) for forecasting purposes. The evidence of non-stationarity indicates that future studies on tax revenue need to carefully reflect on the modeling technique to avoid spurious regressions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that temporary fiscal measures will not have a permanent effect on tax revenue and sustainable revenue growth requires focusing on long-term (rather than short-sighted) reforms. Thus, our findings underscore the importance of evidence-based policy reforms to improve the resilience, efficiency, and sustainability of the tax system in Fiji to shelter it from future adverse shocks.<\/jats:p>","16":"1548-2278"},{"1":"Tail risks of energy transition metal prices for commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.105057","5":"Resources Policy","6":"Resources Policy","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.105057","9":"2024 jun","10":"20.41868","11":"32","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0301-4207"},{"1":"THE INFLUENCE OF WORLD PRICES ON THE NATIONAL PRICING SYSTEM (COMMODITY MARKETS)","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.47576/2712-7559_2022_3_6_536","5":"Industrial Economics","6":"NA","7":"Publishing house Pegas","8":"10.47576/2712-7559_2022_3_6_536","9":"2022 jan","10":"18.50793","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"2712-7559"},{"1":"Systemic risk in global volatility spillover networks: Evidence from option‐implied volatility indices","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22078","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22078","9":"2020 mar","10":"18.51556","11":"30","12":"25","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>With option‐implied volatility indices, we identify networks of global volatility spillovers and examine time‐varying systemic risk across global financial markets.

It is established that the asymptotic risk of the Stein-like shrinkage estimator is smaller than that of the unrestricted estimator, which is the method typically used to estimate the slope coefficients under structural breaks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an averaging minimal mean squared error estimator in which the averaging weight is derived by minimizing its asymptotic risk.

Large‐scale evidence on S&amp;P 500 index options indicates that smile‐implied delta–gamma–vega hedging strategies outperform the BS approach as well as more sophisticated option hedging frameworks, including stochastic volatility and jumps.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Short- and long-term forecasting of electricity prices using embedding of calendar information in neural networks","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100246","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100246","9":"2022 dez","10":"18.88745","11":"56","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Sequential Itô–Taylor expansions and characteristic functions of stochastic volatility models","2":"<tibble[,8]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22455","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22455","9":"2023 dez","10":"20.85834","11":"23","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study proposes a new approach to derive the characteristic function of a general stochastic volatility model by sequentially utilizing the Itô–Taylor expansions.

Existing product review sentiment analysis models based on deep learning mostly use traditional word vector models. It is difficult to obtain the contextual semantic information of words, and there is a problem of “polysemous one word”. A product review sentiment analysis model combining ALBERT and LSTM is proposed. First, we use the ALBERT pre-training model to get the word vector containing sequence and semantic information. Then we use the LSTM model that can obtain long-distance semantic features for training. Finally, the emotional polarity of product reviews is classified and output through the emotional polarity discrimination layer. The experimental results on the data set of digital products of JD Mall show that the F1 value of the ALBERT-LSTM model is improved compared with the ALBERT and LSTM models.<\/jats:p>","16":"1742-6588,1742-6596"},{"1":"Sentiment Analysis of Stock Prices and News Headlines Using the MCDM

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the Brexit referendum on the return and volatility spillover between the EU, the UK, and the USA stock markets and the Indian stock market during the pre- and post-Brexit referendum period. The VAR and bivariate GARCH BEKK models were employed. The study results suggest that before the Brexit referendum, Indian stock market returns made no significant return spillover on the other markets. On the contrary, following the referendum, Indian stock returns significantly spilled over to France, Germany, the UK, and the USA stock market returns. The study results also identified a substantial increase in the bidirectional volatility spillover between India-France, India-UK, and India-USA during the post-Brexit referendum period. Therefore, the investors’ opportunity to invest simultaneously in India, UK, EU, and US stock markets for portfolio diversification is limited. India was affected mainly by its own past shocks before the Brexit referendum. However, after the Brexit referendum, Indian markets are getting more and more integrated with other markets. In order to reap the diversification benefits, a prudent investment strategy will need to be developed in the future, especially during times of economic and political uncertainty and market crisis.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Regime-Switching Processes and Mean-Reverting Volatility Models in Value-at-Risk Estimation: Evidence from the Taiwan Stock

We identify how oil prices and four other energy commodity prices behave using daily data from January 07, 1991 to February 25, 2020. The long-run relationships suggest both oil price increases and decreases are significantly and positively related to the prices of all other energy commodities. There seems to be asymmetry in the linkages between oil prices and all the prices of diesel fuel, gasoline, heating oil and natural gas in the long run. Except for natural gas, the effects of oil price increases are significantly larger than those of oil price decreases. However, in the short run, the results are somewhat different. An asymmetric impact of oil price changes is found for gasoline and the effects of oil price decreases are larger than those of oil price increases. In our model, the real effective exchange rate of the US dollar is explicitly incorporated to capture the linkages between US dollar fluctuations and energy price movements. We find that the relative weakness of the US dollar strengthens the prices of energy commodities in the global market. <\/jats:p>","16":"0217-5908,1793-6837"},{"1":"Novel and old news sentiment in commodity futures markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108006","5":"Energy Economics","6":"Energy Economics","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108006","9":"2024 dez","10":"18.49219","11":"103","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0140-9883"},{"1":"National culture and banks stock volatility","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101932","5":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","6":"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101932","9":"2024 mar","10":"17.97087","11":"76","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"1042-4431"},{"1":"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_6","5":"Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_6","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.73914","11":"17","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Monthly prices for wheat, maize and barley","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/e0cee223-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/e0cee223-en","9":"2023 jul","10":"17.08584","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Monetary policy shocks and stock market volatility in emerging markets","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.22495/rgcv10i3p4","5":"Risk Governance and Control: Financial Markets and Institutions","6":"RGC","7":"Virtus Interpress","8":"10.22495/rgcv10i3p4","9":"2020 jan","10":"17.98968","11":"109","12":"4","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:p>This paper examines the effect of monetary policy decisions on stock markets in emerging economies particularly South Africa for the period 2000Q1 to 2016Q4.

Monetary policy directly shocks money supply and repo rate and indirectly GDP and inflation among many macroeconomic variables. A hypothesis that stock markets do not respond to monetary policy determinations is formulated and tested using a two-stage approach by employing first the vector error correction model to determine the long-run relationship of the variables and secondly GARCH (1, 2) model to determine the volatility.

Overall, there is a negative relationship between M2 and stock market volatility. However, there is a positive link between repo rate and JSE volatility, which is not economically preferable because variations in repo rate influence the aggregate demand of investment on securities.

Hybrid ARMA-GARCH models were created for medium- and long-term forecasts of time series of financial market index prices: ARMA models are used to analyze their linear component, which is a combination of autoregressive models and moving average models, and GARCH models are used to analyze the nonlinear component. which are generalized autoregressive models that depend on the nonconstancy of variance models. Hybrid ARMA-GARCH models eliminate the weaknesses and gaps that exist in each group of models (ARMA and GARCH) separately, which increases their forecasting accuracy and reliability, so they have already been successfully applied to model and forecast daily stock returns for three standard indices in the USA. The purpose of this article is to investigate which of the hybrid ARMA-GARCH models is optimal for forecasting the return of the DAX index, which is the most important stock index of the German securities market. It is the German equivalent of the American Dow Jones Index, has been calculated since 1988 by Deutsche Börse AG and reflects the total return on capital of the largest stock companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (currently 40; by 2021 – 30): calculated as a weighted average of capitalization of the value of Free Float share prices on the Xetra electronic exchange, and also takes into account dividends on shares, assuming that the dividend is reinvested in the share on which it was accrued. The database of this study consisted of the daily closing prices of the DAX index presented on the official website of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange during the period from 01.01.2018 to 09.30.2023 (altogether about 1,500 observations), the stability of the time series was assessed using Expanded Dickey Fuller Liquidity (ADF). The article proposes 7 hybrid models, from which the one that is best suited for modeling the volatility of the DAX index is selected. It is an ARMA (2,3)-EGARCH (1,1) model because it captures volatility and leverage effects on DAX returns and its expected returns more than other models. The selection of the best alternative from the developed array of hybrid models was carried out according to the following criteria: AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), H-QIC (Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion).<\/jats:p>","16":"2521-1250,2521-1242"},{"1":"Modelling Stock Market Volatility using Asymmetric GARCH Models: Evidence from BRICS stock markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1504/gber.2024.10059551","5":"Global Business and Economics Review","6":"GBER","7":"Inderscience Publishers","8":"10.1504/gber.2024.10059551","9":"2024 jan","10":"21.23304","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1097-4954,1745-1329"},{"1":"Modeling the Commodity Prices of Base Metals in Indian Commodity Market Using a Higher Order Markovian Approach","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40953-021-00258-8","5":"Journal of Quantitative Economics","6":"J.

This phenomenon has sparked a fervent debate in academia and in decision‐making circles dealing with volatility spillovers between international stock prices. Accordingly, isolated examinations of single foreign cross‐listing markets appear inadequate. On this basis, the aim of this article is to recognize volatility transmission patterns within international equity markets using a unique and comprehensive sample of highly traded companies simultaneously cross‐listed in the United States and the UK. An important fact to be noted here is that long‐range dependence is statistically proved in the studied cases, which means that the efficient market hypothesis is utterly rejected. Therefore, a multivariate fractionally co‐integrated model is preliminarily used to fit various samples of high‐frequency time series. Resulting residuals are then subject to a deeper analysis, allowing us to reveal significant volatility transmissions between markets of multiple cross‐listed stocks. Causality experiments are finally conducted on processed data. The results show strong bi‐directional volatility causations between various marketplaces. The overall deduction of this work is that price discovery takes place essentially in local and British markets, thus implying a satellite role in the price discovery process for American exchanges.<\/jats:p>","16":"0969-6016,1475-3995"},{"1":"Investigating and forecasting the impact of crop production shocks on global commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0dda","5":"Environmental Research Letters","6":"Environ.

We perform a thorough assessment of the forecasting performances of five econometric and machine learning models using 60 years of data. First, we train the models on production and price data to forecast the monthly price variations for each crop separately considering different time horizons. Next, we implement a cross-validation procedure to identify the models with the most accurate forecasting ability for each crop. After choosing the best forecaster, we identify the most influential producing areas using several local and global model-agnostic interpretation tools. Our findings indicate significant differences among commodities in terms of prediction accuracy, with cocoa exhibiting a higher level of prediction error compared to less volatile markets like maize and soybean. Our results reveal a significant influence of Northern America’s maize and soybean production on the global prices of these commodities. The effects of production on prices are asymmetrical: small decreases in US production lead to substantial price increases, while small increases in production do not systematically decrease prices. In contrast, cocoa price variations are influenced by production coming from several regions, not from a single one.<\/jats:p>","16":"1748-9326"},{"1":"Investigating Stock Market Volatility and other Volatility Sources using Stochastic Volatility Models","2":"<NULL>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.18576/amis/180414","5":"Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences","6":"Appl.

The empirical results show a high level of volatility persistence in all the financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the results indicate significant positive asymmetric behavior in the crude oil and stock markets during the pandemic. The findings further document that gold exhibits a strong resilience during the pandemic period, indicating its hedging ability during crisis periods. Moreover, the results suggest that the EGARCH model is the most appropriate model to capture the volatilities of the financial markets both before and during the pandemic.

In reality, if investors are unable to achieve efficient diversification, such risk may affect stock returns. The purpose of the study is to examine the presence of idiosyncratic volatility and sentiment in the stock markets of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. Monthly idiosyncratic volatility is estimated using the Fama-French three-factor model. A unified sentiment proxy for each market is created by employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions are applied. F-statistics, t-statistics, and adjusted R2s are used to test the presence of idiosyncratic volatility and sentiment in the GCC markets.Findings show that the effect of sentiment on stock returns is observed across all the GCC markets. Investor sentiment can weakly explain the effect of idiosyncratic volatility on stock returns. In general, investors do not price expected idiosyncratic volatility, and only the unexpected part of it affects stock returns. Overall, the first implication for investors is that they must consider market sentiment to predict the cross-section of stock prices and should not completely ignore the influence of idiosyncratic volatility on stocks. Secondly, the implication for policymakers is that they should motivate companies to go public so that investors have more options to diversify their portfolios across different sectors.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Identifying the external and internal drivers of exchange rate volatility in small open economies","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ememar.2023.101085","5":"Emerging Markets Review","6":"Emerging Markets Review","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.ememar.2023.101085","9":"2024 jan","10":"18.76227","11":"49","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1566-0141"},{"1":"How far is too far for volatility transmission?","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100198","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2021.100198","9":"2022 jun","10":"19.12511","11":"63","12":"7","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"How do world commodity prices affect Asian commodity exporting economies?

We further enhance this model by incorporating various key realized moments such as leverage, realized skewness, realized kurtosis, realized upside (“good”) volatility, realized downside (“bad”) volatility, realized jumps, realized upside tail risk, and realized downside tail risk. In order to setup a forecasting model, we use (i) forward and backward stepwise predictor selection and (ii) a model‐based averaging algorithm.

The superior predictive power of the model‐free implied volatility also holds out‐of sample, in different market states and with longer forecasting horizons.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Forecasting stock prices with commodity prices: New evidence from Feasible Quasi Generalized Least Squares (FQGLS) with non-linearities","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101043","5":"Economic Systems","6":"Economic Systems","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101043","9":"2023 jun","10":"18.93220","11":"30","12":"2","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"0939-3625"},{"1":"Forecasting realized volatility: The role of implied volatility, leverage effect, overnight returns, and volatility of realized volatility","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22241","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22241","9":"2021 out","10":"21.92049","11":"62","12":"22","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,7]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>We forecast realized volatility extending the heterogeneous autoregressive model (HAR) to include implied volatility (IV), the leverage effect, overnight returns, and the volatility of realized volatility.

The empirical findings strongly support the effectiveness of this model in accurately forecasting crude oil futures volatility in the post‐COVID‐19 era, compared to the HAR, HAR‐PCA, and HAR‐DL models. Moreover, a robustness check also demonstrates the positive contribution of common factors to the volatility prediction of other commodity futures. Notably, we establish that these common factors act as effective regularizers, mitigating prediction losses within the HAR model in extreme risk events such as the COVID‐19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Forecasting CPI and PPI Using Commodity Prices and Crude Oil Prices: A Comparison of China and United States","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.4236/me.2024.1511055","5":"Modern Economy","6":"ME","7":"Scientific Research Publishing, Inc.","8":"10.4236/me.2024.1511055","9":"2024 jan","10":"18.96976","11":"14","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,3]>","15":"NA","16":"2152-7245,2152-7261"},{"1":"Food–oil volatility spillovers and the impact of distinct biofuel policies on price uncertainties on feedstock markets","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12561","5":"Agricultural Economics","6":"Agricultural Economics","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1111/agec.12561","9":"2020 mai","10":"21.47899","11":"50","12":"12","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Over recent decades, the link between crude oil and agricultural markets has been reinforced following the introduction of biofuels.

Our sectoral‐ and market‐specific measures distinguish tranquil (1995–2005) and crisis episodes (2006–2015), as well as periods during which either consumption mandates or tax credits were enacted to spur biofuels. During the crisis period, crude oil volatility transmissions account for 16% (20%) of price uncertainties in ethanol (biodiesel) feedstock markets on average. Moreover, we find evidence of enhanced volatility transmissions under tax credit regimes compared with consumption mandates.

These results are not associated with static firm‐level factors and our findings are concentrated in high growth firms.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Dynamics of volatility spillover in commodity markets: Linking crude oil to agriculture","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2019.100111","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2019.100111","9":"2020 dez","10":"19.14679","11":"46","12":"84","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Dynamic correlations and volatility spillovers between subsectoral clean‐energy stocks and commodity futures markets: A hedging perspective","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22454","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22454","9":"2023 dez","10":"18.18260","11":"33","12":"7","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study investigates the time‐varying connectedness between subsectoral clean‐energy stocks and fossil fuel energy commodities (crude oil, natural gas, and coal) over the period of December 2013–January 2023 employing the Diebold and Yilmaz approach and the dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. According to the findings, oil transmits the highest volatility spillover shocks to biofuels, and the least to the fuel cell industry. Both natural gas and coal transmit the highest volatility spillover shocks to energy storage, and the least to geothermal and green information technology, respectively. The study also finds strong and time‐varying volatility connectedness among clean‐energy assets and fossil fuels, significantly affected by global extreme events, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict.

Stock returns of two frontier and nine emerging markets, during the data period spanning from August 2000 to March 2020, were analyzed using multivariate asymmetric GARCH-BEKK model around the global financial crisis (GFC). The study results suggest that the structure of cross-markets shocks and volatility spillover between emerging markets are higher during post-GFC. Therefore, this diminishes the possibility of portfolio diversification and investment opportunities to the investors in most of the Asian emerging markets. In the case of Asian frontier markets, most of the volatility generates due to its past shocks and volatility traverse from Asian emerging markets are considerably less. Hence, asset allocations prospects exist in the Asian frontier stock markets. Nevertheless, safe investment strategies need to design to reap diversification benefits from these markets, particularly during financial turmoil and market distress in the future.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Do industries predict stock market volatility?

The study period ranges from the 1st January 2000 or the listing date of the particular stock (whichever is prior) till 31st March 2019. The study contributes to the on-going debate regarding the effect of derivatives on the underlying stock market’s volatility in two ways. Firstly, by taking into consideration the breaks in the volatility and, secondly, studying the effect of single stock futures will allow us to evaluate company-specific response to futures trading directly. The study offers a mixed outcome for the stocks under consideration. However, there is evidence of a decline in unconditional volatility for the majority of the stocks. The overall findings indicate that trading in stock futures may not have any detrimental effect on the underlying stock’s volatility.<\/jats:p>","16":"1810-4967,1812-9358"},{"1":"Dairy product prices, 2001-2031","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/c66bf036-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2022-2031","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/c66bf036-en","9":"2022 jun","10":"17.47300","11":"0","12":"2","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Dairy product prices, 2000-2030","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/f0df88c9-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/f0df88c9-en","9":"2021 jul","10":"17.46749","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Dairy product prices","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/46f0ff58-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2020-2029","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/46f0ff58-en","9":"2020 jul","10":"17.92133","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Cryptocurrency uncertainty and volatility forecasting of precious metal futures markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100305","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100305","9":"2023 mar","10":"18.98119","11":"43","12":"22","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Cross-hedging wild salmon prices","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2024.100390","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2024.100390","9":"2024 mar","10":"21.72633","11":"54","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Cross-Modal Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_5","5":"Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-5776-7_5","9":"2023 jan","10":"18.55216","11":"37","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Cross market predictions for commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2020.06.019","5":"Economic Modelling","6":"Economic Modelling","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.econmod.2020.06.019","9":"2020 set","10":"18.80965","11":"38","12":"24","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"0264-9993"},{"1":"Correction to: A New Test on Asset Return Predictability with Structural Breaks","2":"<NULL>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbad019","5":"Journal of Financial Econometrics","6":"NA","7":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","8":"10.1093/jjfinec/nbad019","9":"2025 jan","10":"16.87007","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1479-8417"},{"1":"Consumer and producer prices in selected rice markets","2":"<NULL>","3":"other","4":"https://doi.org/10.1787/0601dda7-en","5":"OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook,OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030","6":"NA","7":"OECD","8":"10.1787/0601dda7-en","9":"2021 jul","10":"16.93578","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1999-1142"},{"1":"Consumer Prices Trends in Colombia: Detecting Breaks and Forecasting Inflation","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"report","4":"https://doi.org/10.32468/be.1289","5":"NA","6":"NA","7":"Banco de la República","8":"10.32468/be.1289","9":"2024 dez","10":"19.53436","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"<jats:p>Colombia’s annual inflation reached 13.3% in March 2023, the highest rate since the implementation of the inflation-targeting regime for monetary policy in 2000.

The persistence of this trend is actively debated, involving analysis of both year-to-year and month-to-month changes in price indices.\\nIn this paper, we use a time series methodology to identify shifts in inflation levels based on the 188 price indices that comprise the basket. We classify the trend breaks as positive or negative and aggregate them by tradable and non-tradable, core and regulated, and other CPI groups.\\nAdditionally, we employ these trend models, possibly with breaks, to forecast total (bottom-up and middle-up approaches) and group inflation for 2024.

Since these countries play a crucial role in the international economy, it is important for financial market participants to understand the volatility transmission process for designing optimal portfolio allocations. We examine weekly data over the period 1998–2017 and endogenously detect structural breaks in variance using an iterated algorithm in order to estimate the volatility dynamics with greater accuracy. The models were estimated using the maximum likelihood method, and the BFGS algorithm was employed to obtain the variance–covariance estimation and the corresponding standard errors. Overall, we find volatility spillovers between markets together with the fact that the oil market has a leading role. More importantly, we show that neglecting structural changes in variance and/or asymmetries may lead to biased volatility spillover effects. Furthermore, the results highlight that models ignoring structural breaks are significantly overestimating the effect of their own past volatility on the current volatility. In addition, we find that disregarding asymmetries could also lead to erroneous estimates of these effects. Finally, we compute dynamic risk‐minimizing hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights, however, no significant discrepancies are found among the models considered.<\/jats:p>","16":"1076-9307,1099-1158"},{"1":"Asymmetric volatility in cryptocurrency markets: New evidence from smooth transition GARCH models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2019.09.008","5":"Finance Research Letters","6":"Finance Research Letters","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.frl.2019.09.008","9":"2020 jul","10":"20.70332","11":"34","12":"76","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"1544-6123"},{"1":"Asymmetric volatility in commodity markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2020.100139","5":"Journal of Commodity Markets","6":"Journal of Commodity Markets","7":"Elsevier BV","8":"10.1016/j.jcomm.2020.100139","9":"2021 jun","10":"20.72851","11":"55","12":"15","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2405-8513"},{"1":"Asymmetric effects of diesel prices and exchange rates on turkey's food prices","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.21162/pakjas/21.1452","5":"Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Sciences","6":"PAKJAS","7":"Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Sciences","8":"10.21162/pakjas/21.1452","9":"2021 dez","10":"16.68902","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"<jats:p>This study analyses the asymmetric effects of the swings in diesel prices and exchange rates on Turkey’s food prices with the Non-Linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. For this purpose, Turkey’s diesel prices, exchange rate, and general food price index data for the same period between January 2000 and December 2019 were adopted. Considering that diesel prices are an essential cost item in agricultural production, it becomes crucial to determine the effect on food prices. Besides, the exchange rate fluctuations are expressed as another important macro variable that impacts food prices. As a result of the NARDL model, asymmetric co-integration between the general food price index, diesel prices, and the exchange rate was determined. Still, it has been observed that the negative and positive changes in diesel prices on food prices, in the long run, do not have a significant effect. On the other hand, the negative effect of the exchange rate was significant. It is concluded that a 1% decrease in the negative changes in the exchange rate will cause 0.94% decrease in food prices. Consequently, the general food price is affected by adverse shocks on the exchange rate in the long run. One may be concluded that the exchange rate should be considered while formulating policies about the swings in food prices. Especially, the local production of agricultural inputs affected by exchange rate fluctuations could be encouraged.<\/jats:p>","16":"0552-9034,2076-0906"},{"1":"Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_3","5":"SpringerBriefs in Statistics,Stochastic Volatility and Realized Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Singapore","8":"10.1007/978-981-99-0935-3_3","9":"2023 jan","10":"19.00061","11":"24","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"2191-544X,2191-5458"},{"1":"Assessment of Exchange Rate Volatility Using Garch Models: A Case Study from Indian Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.9734/bpi/crbme/v7/129","5":"Contemporary Research in Business, Management and Economics Vol. 7","6":"NA","7":"B P International","8":"10.9734/bpi/crbme/v7/129","9":"2024 mai","10":"19.73970","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Assessing the asymmetric volatility linkages of energy and agricultural commodity futures during low and high volatility regimes","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22477","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22477","9":"2024 mar","10":"24.28539","11":"45","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study investigated the volatility linkages between energy and agricultural futures, including possible causes for these comovements, such as external macroeconomic and financial shocks during low and high volatility regimes.

Overall, the results suggest that energy futures can be effectively used for hedging in a portfolio comprising agricultural futures (and vice versa), while a combination of macroeconomic and financial index futures can serve as an effective hedging tool in investment portfolios comprising both energy and agricultural commodities.<\/jats:p>","16":"0270-7314,1096-9934"},{"1":"Aspect-words Sentiment analysis of commodity comments based on deep memory network","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icesit53460.2021.9696708","5":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Emergency Science and Information Technology (ICESIT)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/icesit53460.2021.9696708","9":"2021 nov","10":"19.48544","11":"9","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,7]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Sub-fractional Hybrid Stochastic Volatility Model","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-03861-7_14","5":"Parameter Estimation in Stochastic Volatility Models","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-03861-7_14","9":"2022 jan","10":"17.94169","11":"29","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,12]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Approximate Bayesian Estimation of Stochastic Volatility in Mean Models Using Hidden Markov Models: Empirical Evidence from Emerging and Developed Markets","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-023-10490-4","5":"Computational Economics","6":"Comput Econ","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s10614-023-10490-4","9":"2024 set","10":"19.10796","11":"42","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"0927-7099,1572-9974"},{"1":"Applications of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in Commodity Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,4]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3531232.3531265","5":"2022 4th International Conference on Image, Video and Signal Processing","6":"NA","7":"ACM","8":"10.1145/3531232.3531265","9":"2022 mar","10":"21.66619","11":"21","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Application of the Algorithm for Analyzing Stock Prices Based on Sentiment Analysis","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/sist58284.2023.10223583","5":"2023 IEEE International Conference on Smart Information Systems and Technologies (SIST)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/sist58284.2023.10223583","9":"2023 mai","10":"20.38088","11":"21","12":"1","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,9]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"Analytical valuation of Asian options with counterparty risk under stochastic volatility models","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22064","5":"Journal of Futures Markets","6":"Journal of Futures Markets","7":"Wiley","8":"10.1002/fut.22064","9":"2020 mar","10":"19.75395","11":"36","12":"18","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,4]>","15":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, we consider Asian options with counterparty risk under stochastic volatility models.

To do this, we consider a vector error correction model over two overlapping periods: 2010–17 and 2010–19. Price discovery is achieved through the Gonzalo–Granger permanent‐transitory decomposition. The pricing factors are endogenous linear combinations of the S&amp;P 500 index, gold price, a Google search variable associated to Bitcoin and a fear index proxied by the FED Financial Stress Index. Our empirical analysis shows that during the first period, a linear combination of four pricing factors describes the efficient Bitcoin price. The S&amp;P 500 index and Google searches have a positive effect whereas gold prices and the fear index have a negative effect. In contrast, during the second period, the efficient price behaves idiosyncratically and can be only rationalised by individuals' search for information on the cryptocurrency. These findings provide empirical evidence on the presence of a correction in Bitcoin prices during the period 2018–19 uncorrelated to market fundamentals.

The QAR model provides a flexible representation of the distribution of price and its dynamics. The approach is applied to U.S. wheat and corn markets over the period of 1980–2017. This period is of significant interest as it covers important changes in agricultural policy and increased reliance on markets. The price analysis is conducted conditional on stocks held in the previous period. We show how increasing previous stocks shift the price distribution to the left and decreases the odds of facing price spikes (by shifting down the upper tail of the price distribution). Our analysis also examines the effects of changing public stocks on prices. For both wheat and corn, this reflects changing agricultural policy, contrasting the 1980s (when public stocks were relatively high) with the post‐2005 period (when public stocks became zero). We document how higher public stock ratio during the previous period did not lower the odds of facing price spikes. Applied to the wheat and corn markets, we also uncover evidence of local dynamic instability in the upper tail of the price distribution, suggesting that price instability becomes more pronounced when previous stocks are low.<\/jats:p>","16":"0169-5150,1574-0862"},{"1":"A note on institutional hierarchy and volatility in financial markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429198557-7","5":"New Facets of Economic Complexity in Modern Financial Markets","6":"NA","7":"Routledge","8":"10.4324/9780429198557-7","9":"2020 jun","10":"18.69696","11":"1","12":"0","13":"<NULL>","14":"<tibble[,2]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"A double mixture autoregressive model of commodity prices","2":"<tibble[,6]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23737484.2021.1882353","5":"Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications","6":"Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications","7":"Informa UK Limited","8":"10.1080/23737484.2021.1882353","9":"2021 abr","10":"20.28977","11":"46","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"NA","16":"2373-7484"},{"1":"A Theoretical Framework for Reconceiving Agricultural Markets","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62562-6_2","5":"The Promise of New Agricultural Markets","6":"NA","7":"Springer Nature Switzerland","8":"10.1007/978-3-031-62562-6_2","9":"2024 jan","10":"18.42246","11":"0","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"A Study of Asymmetric Volatilities in Korean Stock Markets Using Multiple-Regime Stochastic Volatility Models","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.46665/jkes.2020.12.38.4.5","5":"Journal of Korean Economics Studies","6":"jkes","7":"The Association of Korean Economic Studies","8":"10.46665/jkes.2020.12.38.4.5","9":"2020 dez","10":"18.70858","11":"0","12":"1","13":"<NULL>","14":"<NULL>","15":"NA","16":"1598-2742,2465-8286"},{"1":"A Commodity Review Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-CNN Model","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"proceedings-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icccs49078.2020.9118434","5":"2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS)","6":"NA","7":"IEEE","8":"10.1109/icccs49078.2020.9118434","9":"2020 mai","10":"21.14948","11":"8","12":"27","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,8]>","15":"NA","16":"NA"},{"1":"A CEEMD-ARIMA-SVM model with structural breaks to forecast the crude oil prices linked with extreme events","2":"<tibble[,5]>","3":"journal-article","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-07276-5","5":"Soft Computing","6":"Soft Comput","7":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","8":"10.1007/s00500-022-07276-5","9":"2022 set","10":"19.97431","11":"64","12":"8","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,10]>","15":"NA","16":"1432-7643,1433-7479"},{"1":"A Behavioral Approach to Pricing in Commodity Markets: Dual Processing of Prices within and around Willingness-to-Pay Ranges","2":"<tibble[,3]>","3":"book-chapter","4":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90657-3_6","5":"Management for Professionals,Commodity Marketing","6":"NA","7":"Springer International Publishing","8":"10.1007/978-3-030-90657-3_6","9":"2022 jan","10":"18.37395","11":"35","12":"0","13":"<tibble[,4]>","14":"<tibble[,11]>","15":"NA","16":"2192-8096,2192-810X"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

<p>Instead of analyzing individual words, N-gram analysis examines sequences of two or more words that frequently appear together (bi-grams, tri-grams).</p>
<p>Objective: To identify more relevant phrases or compound terms in the literature, which may not be captured in the analysis of individual words.</p>
<p>Application: To discover compound terms like “volatility spillover,” “agricultural prices,” or “portfolio optimization” that frequently appear.</p>

[1] &lt;jats:p&gt;Demand will surge for the minerals for low-carbon technologies, but supply is concentrated and will lag, raising prices&lt;/jats:p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
[2] &lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;\n               &lt;jats:p&gt;This article studies exchange-traded funds’ (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF-dominated asset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. I propose a new way to measure ETF-related price distortions based on the specifics of futures contracts. This allows me to isolate a component in VIX futures prices that is strongly related to the rebalancing of ETFs. I derive a novel decomposition of ETF trading demand into leverage rebalancing, calendar rebalancing, and flow rebalancing, and show that trading against ETFs is risky. Leverage rebalancing has the largest effects on the ETF-related price component. This rebalancing amplifies price changes and exposes ETF counterparties to variance.&lt;/jats:p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
[3] &lt;jats:title&gt;Abstract&lt;/jats:title&gt;&lt;jats:p&gt;Teff is an ancient grain primarily produced in Ethiopia and providing more than 10% of the total calories consumed in the country. The grain is considered as “super grain” due to its nutritional qualities, and it has seen an increase in its demand and price in recent years. These trends raise public concerns about the affordability of the grain and the prevalence of food insecurity in Ethiopia. Therefore, we investigate the impacts of increasing teff prices on consumers’ welfare by regions. Using data from two waves of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey 2013–2014 and 2015–2016, we examine the consumption patterns of cereals in Ethiopia and estimate a two‐stage structural demand system. We find that teff is the most own‐price inelastic grain in Ethiopia and an increase of 10% in teff prices will reduce consumer welfare by 0.81, 1.29, and 1.73 Birrs per week for the average rural, town, and urban consumers, respectively. These estimates correspond to 1.64, 2.31, and 2.46% of their weekly food budgets. We also find the negative effects of an increase in teff prices are smaller for the lower‐income groups as they have relatively lower expenditures on teff. Additionally, we analyze the effects of simultaneous changes in wheat and teff prices to measure the extent to which Ethiopia's food policy of distributing subsidized wheat could offset the consumer welfare loss due to an increase in teff prices.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</code></pre>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Extract underlying topics from texts by grouping related keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Automatically discover the main themes discussed in a large collection of articles. Application: Help identify different research areas within a broader field, for example, whether articles on “sentiment analysis” focus more on price volatility, market predictions, or risk analysis.</p>
<p>To continue with our Exploratory Lit Rev, we first need to build the corpus:</p>

<p>Then we proceed for the next step, cleaning the text:</p>
<p>Now we can build the terms matrix (Term-Document Matrix - TDM), were each row represents an term and each column represents an document.</p>

<p>The graph generated is a topic modeling visualization based on an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model. Each bar shows the most important words in each identified topic, derived from the text data provided. Let’s break down each part:</p>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Axes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>X-axis (“Beta Importance”)</strong>: The “beta” value indicates the probability that the word is relevant to the specific topic. The higher the beta value, the more important the word is in describing that topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Y-axis (Terms)</strong>: Shows the terms (words) that are most representative within each topic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation by Topic:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Topic 1 (red bar)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The most relevant terms include: “novel”, “exposes”, “way”, “contracts”, “volatility”, “surge”, “specifics”, “birrs”, “calendar”, “consumer.”</p></li>
<li><p>These terms suggest a set of documents focused on <strong>new contracts</strong> or <strong>methods</strong> related to volatility and consumption. The term “volatility” indicates that this topic likely discusses market fluctuations or innovations in managing contracts and consumption.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topic 2 (green bar)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most relevant terms: “contracts”, “propose”, “studies”, “etfs”, “correspond”, “lag”, “measure”, “new”, “consumption”, “based.”</p></li>
<li><p>This topic seems to be related to <strong>studies</strong> proposing the use of <strong>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</strong> and financial contracts, with a focus on <strong>consumption measures</strong> and market response <strong>lags</strong>. It could be discussing proposals for new studies on contracts and ETFs related to different consumption patterns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topic 3 (blue bar)</strong></p>
<ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploratory-literature-review-with-text-mining-final-considerations">Exploratory Literature Review with Text Mining: Final Considerations</h2>
<p>In this section, we applied text mining techniques to explore the main themes and trends in the literature related to sentiment analysis, volatility models, structural breaks, and multiobjective portfolio optimization in agricultural markets. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method was used to extract latent topics from the abstracts of papers, providing insights into the key terms that characterize the body of research.</p>
<section id="key-insights-from-topic-modeling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-insights-from-topic-modeling">Key Insights from Topic Modeling</h3>
<p>Three topics were identified through LDA, each represented by a set of significant terms with their respective importance (Beta values):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Topic 1</strong> primarily emphasizes <strong>GARCH models</strong>, including terms like “bekk-garch” and “dcc-garch,” as well as terms related to <strong>market quality</strong>, <strong>volatility spillovers</strong> (“vov”), and <strong>settlement</strong> effects. This topic highlights a focus on econometric models used to assess volatility and risk in financial markets, with applications to agricultural commodities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topic 2</strong> features terms such as “return,” “option-impli,” and “long,” indicating that this topic revolves around the <strong>long-term returns</strong> and <strong>option pricing</strong> in agricultural markets. Other terms like “find” and “pcs” suggest explorations of statistical methods used to identify patterns and model market behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topic 3</strong> focuses on <strong>spillovers</strong> and <strong>global market trends</strong>, with terms like “spillov,” “precis,” “global,” and “detect.” This topic suggests an emphasis on <strong>crisis detection</strong>, <strong>market interdependence</strong>, and the global nature of agricultural commodities. The presence of “india” and “japan” also suggests the regional analysis of agricultural markets.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-future-research">Implications for Future Research</h3>
<p>The results of this exploratory text mining analysis indicate that the literature in the field of agricultural market volatility, sentiment analysis, and portfolio optimization is deeply rooted in econometric modeling, risk assessment, and global market interconnections. Moving forward, researchers may want to delve further into the integration of sentiment metrics with econometric models to enhance predictive capabilities, especially in the context of volatility and structural breaks.</p>
<p>By leveraging these insights, future work could focus on developing multiobjective optimization strategies that incorporate both <strong>financial metrics</strong> and <strong>qualitative sentiment data</strong>, offering a more holistic approach to managing risk and improving investment decisions in agricultural markets.</p>
